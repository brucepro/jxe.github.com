I&#x27;ve gathered here notes for three societies, an ongoing exploration of different social values and of the rituals which might reproduce them. The rituals and games here have been tried, have been tested, their instructions refined. Many are played regularly. But the societies that could hold them together are not (yet) real.</p><p>Within each society grouping, the first games listed are good for beginners, then harder games, and lastly those requiring advanced training. A few of these rituals (as noted) are by other designers.  A few appear in more than one grouping. -- Joe</p></div><h1><small>Before you, in boxes,</small>a library of rituals and group games</h1><ul><li><a href="#recuBQerNFM1DnRKy">Rituals of Aspiration</a><br/><p class="byline">A response to startup culture.

Practices of self-examination, humility, extravagance, and interpersonal grace; aiming at a culture of nuanced, humble endeavors.</p><div class="blurb"><span><p>I travel between San Francisco--home of a naive and destructive optimism--and Berlin, with less naivete, but also less vision. Can we build a group with the advantages of both? I guess that this means being <em>extravagant</em> (willing to consider bold moves), <em>self-examined</em> (willing to examine all of your hypotheses about impact and society), <em>humbled</em> (able to endure despair and disillusionment again and again), and <em>gracious</em> (with the &quot;yes and&quot; instinct from improv theater so we can explore the consequences of silly ideas together).</p>

They may share the epitaph they want on their tombstone, the first lines of their obituary, etc.  THEN, a player or two are randomly chosen and ritually killed.  The rest of the group decides on a memorial object or action to create in memory of that player.  The player gets to return later and experience their memorial.  As time allows, another player is killed, and so on.</p><dl><dt>Key values</dt><dd><span>extravagance</span></dd><dt>Play during</dt> <dd><span>group fun</span></dd></dl></div><div class="Game"><h4>Hopeless but worth considering</h4><p>A quadrant is drawn on a whiteboard.  The y-axis runs from Hopeless → Hopeful, and x-axis from Dumb → Worth Considering Strategies. Players call out world issues or concerns that they believe are hopeless but worth considering. The group decides where on the graph these issues belong. The goal is to find a concern feels hopeless for those in the room, but also seems worth strategizing about by those in the room, the speaker gets a point.</p><dl><dt>Key values</dt><dd><span>humility</span></dd><dt>Play during</dt> <dd><span>group discussions</span></dd></dl></div><div class="Game"><h4>Reality prototyping</h4><p>A stack of blank index cards goes in the middle of the group. A timer is set for 10 or more minutes. Everyone starts with a minute or so in silence, and then they pick up a card and write something that could be done, by one of the other group members, that they think would be interesting for the group. This instruction is written on a card and placed face down. After the first minute, everyone balances their time roughly equually between three activities: (1) looking around and appreciating whatever is happening; (2) picking up a face-down card and performing whatever instruction is written on it; or (3) noticing something else that it would be nice if someone did it, and writing a new instruction on a new card.

After each person shares, another player responds with a “dream team” -- a list of either specific people or specific professions that would be useful in neutralizing the concern/fulfilling the aspiration. Players should take the concern/aspiration at face value and work to find a dream team that would help. They should not try to talk the sharer out of the concern.</p><dl><dt>Key values</dt><dd><span>extravagance</span></dd><dt>Play during</dt> <dd><span>group discussions</span></dd></dl></div><div class="Game"><h4>Empowering Redesign Game</h4><p>When the group wishes to practice empowering design, or the development of deep metrics, the following may be a good structure:

Review the basics.  Someone can go through the companion worksheet and gather from the crowd new examples of unnecessary concerns, weird thinking styles, and distorted ways of relating to people, to refresh everyone on the terminology we’ve found useful. It is also useful to remind the crowd that to design our lives and relationships through technology is an unfamiliar activity, very different from designing screens. E.g. &quot;We didn&#x27;t come here to do traditional design – laying out rectangles, interactions, or other things we’re already good at. This is a new practice.”

Identify some lifestyle distortions.  Some members of the group will volunteer to be “users.”  These people will take a moment to write down a description of how their lives have been distorted by some software: whether they find themselves using software when they would rather be offline, or communicating and relating in different ways than they might like, etc.  They use the “unnecessary concerns, weird thinking styles, and distorted ways of relating to people” terminology in describing these distortions.
 
Circulate as designers and see how to repair the software.  The remainder of the group will play the role of designers trying to repair the software and eliminate these distortions, aligning the users’ technology use with what matters to them.  Designers may interview their user about their lives and usage and about how the user wants to relate to friends, what they want to think about, etc.

Capture the best work.  If promising designs arise, there should be someone in the group whose job it is to capture them, in paper prototype form, for the shared dropbox folder of the movement, and to notify others in the movement to tweet about them or to arrange things so that the redesigns are likely to be considered by the companies who make the redesigned software.  Some members of the group may want to take on the task of further refining the designs for presentation in a gallery.</p><ul class="thumbnails"><a href="https://dl.airtable.com/ShFJvukMSSuQ20InMZw2_TimeWellSpentLivableTechRunningEventsandCreatingCommunity.pdf"><img src="https://dl.airtable.com/attZIfT0my9HfgUzz-28x36.png"/></a></ul><dl><dt>Key values</dt><dd><span>humility</span><span>self-examination</span></dd><dt>Play during</dt> <dd><span>group discussions</span></dd></dl></div><div class="Game"><h4>Applause Walk</h4><p>Two people go for a walk in silence.

The other gives him attention and prompts him if he starts to go into stories, analysis, the past or the future, anything that&#x27;s not his current emotional state.  The attending player may also prompt for bigger modes of emotional expression.

The person to their left gets to ask ONE clarifying question, and the sharer answers. After ONE clarifying question, someone else presents a new concern/aspiration. If a player thinks a question is particularly insightful or shrewd, they might high-five the question-asker.

Announce that anyone can, if they find someone with a number lower than theirs, ask for a challenge. The challenge should be possible and ideally, fun. If they succeed, they get to trade for the lower number.
