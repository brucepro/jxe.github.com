  <h2>Cost/Benefit Signals for Browsing and Buying</h2>

<div id="body" class="container"></div><textarea id="text" style="display:none">

We all know what it's like to regret certain hours spent on our phones or our computers.  Similarly, we've all bought things that we didn't end up using.  But could our devices have helped us make a clearer choice, before we spent that hour or bought that thing?  Was there information available--information that we simply weren't shown?  We'll first look at how costs and benefits are displayed on our devices today, then turn to a new appoach, where choices are linked to common intended outcomes, the likelihood of regret, and related activities, so that interested users can make an *informed choice*.  Finally we'll look at the social benefits of moving from a society of marketing-driven consumption to one of where outcome-informed choices and outcome-informed discovery drive online activity--i.e., a society where providers are focused on creating good long-term outcomes in users' lives.


## Costs

First lets consider *direct costs*, often denominated either in dollars or hours.  When it's dollars, we are used to a certain level of transparency.  Products are listed with their prices, and we consider it a bad business practice when there are hidden costs via fees or other tricks.

However, we put up with hidden *time costs* every day.  Only the greatest web products display estimates of time to engage.

<img src="img/medium.png" class="zoomed">

Obviously some products would need to be unbundled to have their direct costs make sense:

<img src="img/fb-read-time.png" class="zoomed">



## Benefits

Benefits are more subtle.  Often they guide us subconsciously and we don't exactly know what we are searching for. Nonetheless, as we browse options, we have certain idealized outcomes in mind that structure our search, and we make local choices with those in mind.

The closest thing to a standard for conveying benefits are the highlighted [collocations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation)--phrases of special significance--pulled out of reviews by Yelp, Amazon, and Google.

<img src="img/yelp.png" class="zoomed">


Collocations capture *features* of a product or service, like "great view" and "mozarella sticks", but they don't capture our actual hopes, which are both more general and more specific--things like "quality time with friends", "an adventurous weekend", "feeling refreshed", "getting fit", or "learning to knit".  A few products do go more directly after these outcomes.

![](img/meetup-unresolutions.png)

The products above--Yelp, DIY, Meetup--are especially aligned with user wellbeing.  Naming outcomes outright produces incredulity unless there are good and plausible outcomes to name.  This is why cigarette and beer commercials are so oblique.  But even companies like Yelp or Meetup do not attempt to provide information about how well and efficiently they work, i.e. the probability of reaching each benefit by using the product with a given investment of time.

Indeed, it's not clear if anyone knows the overall likelihood of getting fit by joining a running meetup, or finding a life partner by investing 40 hours in a dating app.  Do these things work out?  What kind of investment is required for what kind of payoff?  How do the alternatives compare?  The data will likely be fuzzy, different for different demographics perhaps, but why not collect it and see?



## Thinking about thinking about choices

The tech industry is all about marketplaces and menus, but somehow we still lack good ways to talk about choice.  One the one hand we often treat the user as having no agency--we talk about technology in terms of optimized funnels, addiction, or novelty-seeking, we throw around the names of neurotransmitters like dopamine, and VCs exhort would-be founders to focus on the seven deadly sins.  On the other hand we often interpret our success with clicks, views, and repeat users as clear articulations of what the user "wants", and take engagement as proof that we are helping people.

<div class="sidenote">
Which explanation we choose is vital:  for explanation (a), its important to provide "speedbumps" or to otherwise deprive the addict of their drug.  For the others, the focus should be on providing better situations for people and better opportunities at the moment of choice.
</div>

Economics has done better.  Starting with the difficult case of explaining "addictive" behavior, we find three common types of explanations:  (a) as a kind of impairment of the ability to choose  ("OMG I just spent 4 hours on facebook."), (b) as a rational choice made with a misunderstanding  ("I thought I could spend just a few minutes!" or "I thought it'd make me popular and happy!"), or (c) as a rational choice made in a bad situation ("Life sucks lets get high and watch cat videos.").

Although pop culture is stuck with explanation (a), economists have focused on (b) and (c) because of [a landmark paper by Becker and Murphy](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1830469?uid=3737864&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21104100113327) which found that cigarette smoking and heroin use are sensitive both to announcements of future tax levels and to independent improvements in life circumstances.  That is, people do stop doing heroin when they suddenly have a chance to go to college, and they can stop smoking if they figure out it's going to be more expensive than they thought.  I.e., if they recalculate the direct costs or opportunity costs.

That said, the overwhelming majority of heavy smokers regret their decision to start.  Indeed, some decisions we make more often--buying a donut, downloading angry birds, visiting facebook--have quite a high chance of being regretted, especially if we feel later we could have organized something social, more fun, healthier, etc, for ourselves.  What is this regret all about?  Did we or did we not make a choice?

One explanation is that we have states of mind where it is too difficult to figure out better options for ourselves, even if we think abstractly that they may exist.  The activities that we regret are the ones where we know (at least later) that we could have done better by ourselves.  In the case of the donut, we could have found better food, and in the case of facebook, a better form of social engagement, but the search itself seemed exhausting.

<div class="sidenote">
Unfortunately, the &ldquo;engagement metrics&rdquo; which are driving attention on phones are in conflict with this. An internet built on virality, popularity, top grossing and most downloaded apps, clicks, views, likes, shares, reshares, etc--fosters a kind of group impulsiveness that leads away from time well spent.
</div>

<div class="highlight">
The opportunity for technology, then, is in helping us with that search:  helping us position the hopes behind an action--conscious or unconscious--within the space of alternatives and their likely outcomes and costs.  If we can do this, our users will review their time choices as having been time well spent.  A lifetime reviewed as time well spent is, in other words, a life well lived.
</div>




## Benefits: a named-outcome approach

The space of unconscious, desired outcomes may be small enough that it can be canonicalized, visually represented, and outcome-tracked, including synonyms, hypernyms, etc.  For instance, while there is infinite variety to human pursuits, a good start can be made by tracking only terms related to ideal schedules (e.g. "frequent exercise"), ideal personal states (e.g. "getting hitched"), and ideal tactics (e.g., "acting boldly").

Here's *facebook.com*, augmented by a hypothetical chrome plugin.  The plugin is indicating that the outcomes the user may have in mind haven't quite worked out for others.  Here, the red bars next to "mindless reading" and "feeling relaxed" indicate that facebook does not have a good track record for those two desired outcomes.

Clicking or hovering could reveal hints as to what other engagements might work better.

<img src="img/fb-w-hint.png" class="zoomed">

And the same for physical goods:

<img src="img/amazon-warning.png" class="zoomed">

Furthermore, outcome data could structure browsing and discovery interfaces that otherwise couldn't exist.  We can look at reorganizing device home screens, new groupings in recommendation and discovery interfaces like Google Now, and restructuring the app-user relationship including switching from notifications to value- and outcome-aware opportunity suggestions.

<img src="img/siri.jpg" class="smaller"><img src="img/gnow.png" class="smaller">

The goal would be to provide data at the moment when important life choices are made, including discovery, purchasing, calendaring, and browsing choices.  For instance, in calendaring, activities could become first class objects:

<div class="sidenote">
Two Lives Left -- a demo calendar app using our data, that helps you visualize your life and makes it easy to add exercise, friend dates, and the things that make you happy to your week, and browse the web for activities (not just events!) to add to your calendar. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sand-calendar-day-planner/id687579461
</div>

## Verifying outcomes

OK, but how would we collect this data? We are all familiar with the venerable five-star review.

![](img/stars.png)

These reviews--while they guide us better than popularity and virality metrics--don't reflect observed outcomes.  A product like Angry Birds can receive excellent reviews and still be a regretted engagement for many users.  Besides unexpected time costs, someone might have downloaded angry birds to take a relaxing break from work, then later found that they weren't relaxed, or that there was an option that worked better for them for work breaks.  We need a review that would capture this information.

Reviewers will need to be reminded of the costs involved in the engagement, to be given a quick and articulate way to report what the engagement was *about* for them, and then to report how their desired outcomes have worked out so far and what else has happened.  Occasionally, they'll need to be able to extend the schema of desired outcomes in a way that keeps the schema tight.

Here's a first attempt at a values-aware, retrospective review:

<img src="img/review-markup.png">

To provide meaningful signals across the top apps and web products, we won't need millions of reviews, but we would need an articulate, representative, and accurately retrospective set of reviewers.  Perhaps like the Nielsen families but for the internet age, and capturing not just the fact of the engagement, but what it was about.  We need to know what basket of solutions the user engaged with, how much time and money was invested (verified, ideally, with the service provider or the platform), and whether the user felt good retrospectively about their expected and unexpected outcomes.



## Collective wisdom

If we were to collect a small number (say [50,000](/OpenOutcomes/)) of these reviews, we might have a significant public resource.

When the same user reviews multiple engagemeents across the same or different desired outcome, we can start to map migrations.  How do people change their activities as they learn about what's possible or what satisfies them?  In the map below, an arrow is drawn when reviewers tend to migrate in one direction only from activity to activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively so they stick with it.

<img src="img/activities.png" class="zoomed">

Many such maps are possible, creating an opportunity for data visualizers and storytellers [to map our collective wisdom](/OpenOutcomes/). What do people that want to "be successful" or "get fit" tend to want 6 months or a year later?  Which desires are the most durable--are a users current desires likely to last through short-term changes in perspective?  What works best for getting fit--apps, gyms, trainers, fitness buddies, or equipment?  What do people try first?

<div class="sidenote">
Collective wisdom about outcomes may eventually be a distributed, internet-level concern, below the content and application layers.
</div>

A community database would be useful: like Wikipedia, but focused on life choices made, what they were about for the individuals involved, and how it all worked out.  Visitors could review choices about downloading/using apps, websites, products, etc--but they could also review larger life choices, like moving to a new city, quitting a job, and so on.

## Social benefits of informed choice

The epidemics currently facing the modernized countries--obesity, social isolation, depression, a lack of meaningful work, etc--reveal a stunning misalignment between the true interests of the "users" of the economy, on the one hand, and industry and marketing, on the other.  Engineering a realignment will involve both (a) detecting whether and how best our true interests can be satisfied, and (b) changing incentives for businesses and organizations to align with that long-term satisfaction.  It's possible that implementing *informed choice* on our smartphones will accomplish both, by redirecting demand to the best choices.  Even if informed choice interfaces are insufficient to change demand, it's certain that retrospective reviews provide a better measurement of what was in our true interests and what was not than do clicks, views, etc.  We can then decide as a society whether to disincentivize business which operate through leading us into activities we regret.

In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes claimed that the sales metrics that drive capitalism would at some point start driving us in the wrong direction.  He writes that our society would have a collective "nervous breakdown" unless:

> "we shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well."

Perhaps it's finally time to follow Keynes' advice, and to better align economic demand with retrospective reports of informed and fulfilled lives.  Can we measure demand with the question &ldquo;what are you glad that you bought?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;what did you buy?&rdquo;, or online, with &ldquo;what are you glad you clicked?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;what did you click?&rdquo;  Can we tether the lifeblood of our economy--cashflow, attention, and resources--to reports of informed and fulfilled lives?  Would people then work together to create the best outcomes for one another--in much the same way they currently collaborate to generate sales, clicks, and views?

If we were imagine our society focused on incentivize these longer-term forms of satisfaction, how would we collectively choose differently?  How would such an outcome economy be different from the consumption economy we have today?

## Next steps

Help us with [the OpenOutcomes project](/OpenOutcomes/), which will collect the first 50,000 reviews and find exciting stories to about what people try vs what works out, within the areas of fitness, education, and sociality.
