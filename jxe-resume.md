## As a consultant.

* *Data architecture* - I've helped companies think about object and database design, latency and scalability, frameworks, numbers of servers, project sizing, etc. 

* *Social design* - I've helped dramatically improve flows that connect strangers and friends in realworld or chat activities, built event suggestion interfaces with 100-1000x improved conversions, and dramatically improved signup stickiness by engineering community across many products.
