  <h2>A community platform for outcomes data</h2>
  <h3>Joe Edelman / May 2014</h3>
</header>
<div id="body" class="container"></div><textarea id="text" style="display:none">

**OpenOutcomes** is a six month project for a small team to gather 50,000 retrospective reviews as described in [the "Informed Choice" paper](/InformedChoice/), to tell some beautiful stories from the data, and to make a community site where anyone can review the decisions that have been important to them and to navigate others' reviews and choices in a variety of formats.

We are looking for about **$60k in funding** and for **4-6 dataviz designers / journalists interested in two week residencies** to tell stories and make navigable interfaces from our reviwbase, including telling stories about how people's activities and goals change as they live, and which goals and activities they wish they had known about sooner, etc.

**Early access to our database** of 50k retrospective reviews of the top apps and websites in the world will be made to organizations who send us at least $10k in funding.

At conclusion of the project we will make our dataset availble as JSON and via other means to enable app and web discovery and shopping experiences that infer users' desired outcomes and make suggestions based on them.  We hope teams from Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Firefox New Tab Page will use our data to make outcome- and values-driven versions of their software, and that Google will adapt Android notifications, the Play store, and Chrome for a world where it's possible to highlight options that are relevant to the lives people want to live.
