**OpenOutcomes** is a six month project to gather data about what people find most valuable in life, and to illustrate the value of that data in remaking the online experience.

The end goal is to pave the way for consumer tech (apps, websites, and devices) that we can trust with our lives.  Through a set of partnerships, we will be gathering a library of [retrospective reviews](/Choicemaking/) (reviews about which products/purchases/apps/venues/etc were *time well spent*).  Information derived from these reviews can be used for rankings in app stores, for gating mobile notifications, for web browsing recommendations, and to make other systems of attention (feeds, shopping experiences, etc) that align with what's noble and enduringly fulfilling in human life, rather than just what generates clicks, views, downloads, purchases, etc.

A small team will gather 50,000 retrospective reviews as described in [the "Online Menus and Human Choicemaking" paper](/Choicemaking/), and a set of visiting designer / storytellers will create stories and exploration experiences with the data.  Besides these stories, we will also make a community site where anyone can review the decisions that have been important to them, navigate others' reviews and choices in a variety of formats, and where interested parties can access the raw data.

We are looking for **5-7 dataviz designer / journalists who are game for a two week residency** to tell stories and make navigable interfaces from our reviewbase, including stories about how people's activities and goals change as they live, and which goals and activities they wish they had known about sooner, etc. See below for more on the role.

We are also gathering about **$60k in funding**.  Early access to our database of 50k retrospective reviews of the top apps and websites in the world will be made to organizations who send us at least $10k in funding.

At conclusion of the project we will make our dataset availble as JSON and via other means to enable app and web discovery and shopping experiences that infer users' desired outcomes and make suggestions based on them.  We hope teams from Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Firefox New Tab Page will use our data to make outcome- and values-driven versions of their software, and that Google will adapt Android notifications, the Play store, and Chrome for a world where it's possible to highlight options that are relevant to the lives people want to live.

## The role of our visiting data storytellers

Residencies for visiting designers / data visualizers / data storytellers will be during Aug/Sep/Oct/Nov.

By this time, a substantial database of reviews will have been collected, and your job will be to tell one compelling story from that data that is relevant for people's lives.  You may focus on areas like fitness, love, cities, quality time with friends, career changes, etc.

Data will have been collected via the "retrospective review", pictured in the section "Collective Wisdom" of [the paper](http://nxhx.org/Choicemaking/).  It asks questions like:  (a) what apps and websites and products have you used a lot?  (b) what was the choice to use that app about for you?  (e.g., for okcupid, "finding love": answers are normalized across repondents);  (c) did those desires work out with this app/website/product?; (d) if yes, how does it fit into your life now (schedule of use, etc);  (e) if no, did something else help you with that? ("finding love");

An example schema is here:

* https://github.com/OpenOutcomes/hindsight/blob/master/doc/example-data.coffee

Each designer / datavisualizer / storyteller will produce a web experiment thing that will go into an online gallery, which we hope will feel kind of like Bostock's bl.ocks.org and like okcupid's OkTrends blog, but focused on this database of collective wisdom about life choices, desires, and outcomes.  Some of these web experiments will be explorable interfaces and some will be more like blog posts or stories with interactive elements.  Each designer will have the assistance of a query person to help them extract just the info they need and to keep their statistical claims in check, and *some* help from a frontend person if they need it.  We're looking mostly here for people who can take a JSON file and make a beautiful compelling exploratory experience that works on the web.  So familiarity with either D3.js or RaphaelJS etc etc, and a portfolio with some of these kinds of works.  And above all a sense of beauty and humanity.
