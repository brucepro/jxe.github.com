<div id="body" class="container"></div><textarea id="text" style="display:none">

**OpenOutcomes** is a six month project for a small team to gather 50,000 retrospective reviews as described in [the "Informed Choice" paper](/InformedChoice/), to tell some beautiful stories from the data, and to make a community site where anyone can review the decisions that have been important to them and to navigate others' reviews and choices in a variety of formats.

<div class="sidenote">
We're talking here about people who can, with the assistance of someone who knows the schema well and can help them extract the right data, take a JSON file and make a beautiful compelling exploratory experience that works on the web.  So familiarity with either D3.js or RaphaelJS etc etc, and a portfolio with some of these kinds of works.  And above all a sense of beauty and humanity.
</div>

We are looking for **4-6 dataviz designer / journalists who are game for a two week residency** to tell stories and make navigable interfaces from our reviewbase, including stories about how people's activities and goals change as they live, and which goals and activities they wish they had known about sooner, etc.  *You may focus on areas like fitness, love, cities, quality time with friends, career changes, etc.*

We are also gathering about **$60k in funding**.  Early access to our database of 50k retrospective reviews of the top apps and websites in the world will be made to organizations who send us at least $10k in funding.

At conclusion of the project we will make our dataset availble as JSON and via other means to enable app and web discovery and shopping experiences that infer users' desired outcomes and make suggestions based on them.  We hope teams from Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Firefox New Tab Page will use our data to make outcome- and values-driven versions of their software, and that Google will adapt Android notifications, the Play store, and Chrome for a world where it's possible to highlight options that are relevant to the lives people want to live.
