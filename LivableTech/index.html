    <h2>Human Interfaces and a Human Economy</h2>

    There is a sense in the tech sector that something's wrong with how consumer products succeed or fail. So much of the competition is about maximizing screen "engagement" and further mediating relationships. Could software compete, instead, to improve human lives? By measuring success differently, by designing differently, and by changing how the platforms work, we believe we can introduce a new game for the tech sector (and the rest of the economy)--a game about serving lives and relationships well.
