What do big tobacco, facebook newsfeed, angry birds, and donut shops have in common?  They are businesses that rely on getting people to do things they will later regret.  <!--Businesses that encourage people to make low-quality decisions.-->  What do picnics in parks, playing games with your kids, doing DIY home projects, and recalling your childhood dreams have in common?  They are rarely regretted activities, but they have proven difficult to monetize and to market.

<!--When people decide to do these things, they will later say that it was a high-quality decision.-->

As our phones guide ever more of our time allocation and purchasing decisions, it is desirable that information about what we are likely and unlikely to regret become part of the interface.  Yet the kinds of "engagement" metrics that currently guide decision making on phones--virality, popularity, top grossing and most downloaded apps, clicks, views, shares, reshares--are steps in entirely the wrong direction, moving our "collective intelligence" in the direction of mob impulsivity, like the tabloid headlines we see on buzzfeed and upworthy, rather than towards the kind of thoughtful wisdom that's most helpful for living our lives.

The current best practice for collecting retrospective wisdom on the internet is the five star review.  And for sure these reviews produce better guidance than do popularity and virality metrics.  But we think the internet can do better than the five star review.  We are about to prove it.


## A data commons, reviewing all kinds of choices

We will make a collaboratively-edited community database.  A structured-data Wikipedia about life choices made, what they were about for the individuals involved, and how it all worked out.  Eventually we'll include outcomes data for big life choices, like moving to a new city or quitting your job, but we're going to start with smaller choices, like downloading and using a particular fitness app, visiting a meetup, or buying some outdoor gear with the idea of hiking more.  At the center of our site lies a new survey instrument.  A replacement for the five star review.  We call it a values-aware, retrospective review.

In addition to this community site and the retrospective review, we will also make some supporting materials:  a data blog, a poster for sale, and a couple demo applications of our dataset.

* The "Lives Well Lived" poster -- a beautiful wall poster that shows how people's activities and goals change as they live, and which goals and activities they wish they had known about sooner.  Designed by some talented guest infoviz designers and with an accompanying d3.js site.  (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/dtz6sw7199qfh18/activities.png for an example map of activity migrations)

* Two Lives Left -- a demo calendar app using our data, that helps you visualize your life and makes it easy to add exercise, friend dates, and the things that make you happy to your week, and browse the web for activities (not just events!) to add to your calendar.  (see https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sand-calendar-day-planner/id687579461 for an alpha version)

* Goal Goggles -- a demo chrome extension using our data, which changes the browsing experience to give you heads-up when following a link is not in alignment with your current or life goals, and guides you towards better uses of your web time.  (see https://github.com/timewellspent/NoRegrets for some previous work with Aza Raskin that we'll be repurposing)



## After launch

After our site is live, we hope enter into a set of data partnerships that can support value- and outcome-aware discovery and shopping experiences across the web.  We hope teams from Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Firefox New Tab Page will use our data to make outcome- and values-driven versions of their software, and that Google will adapt Android notifications, the Play store, and Chrome for a world where it's possible to highlight options that are relevant to the lives people want to live.

We hope to provide data at the moment when important life choices are made, including purchasing, calendaring, and browsing choices.  We want to have economic demand--which increasingly starts with our phones--be driven by reports of informed and fulfilled lives.  Collective wisdom will eventually be a distributed, internet-level concern, below the content and application layers, and people will work together to create the most fulfilling outcomes for one another.



## The time is now

In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes saw that the particular metrics that drive capitalism--sales, clicks, views, etc--would at some point cease to be useful and in fact would start driving us in the wrong direction.  He writes that our society would have a collective "nervous breakdown" unless:

> "we shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well."

He was right.  It's happening.  It's time to address the situation and to better align economic demand with retrospective reports of informed and fulfilled lives.  We should start measuring demand with the question “what are you glad that you bought?” instead of “what did you buy?”, and “what are you glad you clicked?” rather than “what did you click?”



## State of the project

We have built, already, whatever we felt was necessary to prove this is possible:

### The Review
We have been iterating for months on the basic data collection instrument, the values-driven review, eventually meant to replace all five star and thumbs-up reviews across the internet.

### An early alpha of the calendar app
Find it here on iTunes and play with it.  Try installing a few activities from the "activity store" in your calendar dock.  We will be adding integration with the community site as part of this project.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sand-calendar-day-planner/id687579461

### A first version of the chrome extension
A collaboration with Aza Raskin. It is currently in private beta but you can install it yourself from the github repo.  https://github.com/timewellspent/NoRegrets

### A study to see if people would accept better suggestions
We tested about 3000 teenagers to see if different event and activity suggestions would change how they spend their social time.  There were big changes!  Here's the interface we used.  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hzzsdtcjzh4pv55/jvoZ8M0YYm

We are now moving into the contruction of the data commons, navigation experiences, and the cross-platform survey instrument, proper.



## Assumptions to test

* Can our data collection methods scale to tens of thousands of users and create clean, reliable data?
* Does the data about app regrets, website regrets, lifetime shifts in goals and activities... does it remain impactful as we sample a broader set of demographics?
* Does the output from these reviews correspond to our intuitive notions of fulfillment?
* When branding on reviewed objects communicates their structure, do these reviews motivate  conversions better?
* Can we make accurate predictions about lifestyle improvement and fulfillment?
* Does our information dramatically lower transaction costs / friction around finding / achieving fulfilling lifestyles?
* Can we to collect data that will allow us to answer the following kinds of questions clearly?
  * Are these goals that I am pursuing personally or organizationally, likely to last through changes in perspective?
  * Is this resource that I'm considering for an activity likely a good use of my time/money towards that goal?  Are there better activities and resources?




## Open standards

As part of our work, we will propose and document potential web standards which can be used to connect an outcome-aware ecosystem on the internet.

For instance, we will propose a new URL scheme for personalization,  *desires://*, which can connect sites and apps that help the user specify what they want out of the day, the week, or their lives, with apps that provide relevant discovery and time-management experiences.

The standard will combine "read it later" / Google Keep / Pocket / Reading List type uses with aspirational calendaring ("I want to run 3x/wk") and traditional calendaring, and provide these services with a common URL scheme.



## Funding

Tracking and surfacing outcomes through reviews is a high-trust economic activity, and an ecosystem concern--one which cannot be trusted to advertising companies and attention monopolies.  That's why we're turning to you.
