#* <a id="cardparties"></a> **Card Parties** are events where guests at a party are assigned precisely-timed tasks, distributed on little cards or via SMS.  Tasks interweave. Strangers find themselves in intimate encounters, quiet moments, facing challenges together, being theatrical, etc.  I have [an old FAQ](/misc/notecard-party-faq.html) for running one of your own and [some software and a mission database](http://github.com/jxe/Participatorium) that will help.
#
#* **Wish-fulfillment Card Parties** (2006,2007) -- At daylong events with 300 people, everyone was asked to make a wish for something that could realistically happen to them at the event that they would love.  A team of 30 people used a group editing and revision process to derive assignments for all 300 that, taken together, would make each person's wish come true.


## Possibly upgrade text:
#* **[SandboxSF](https://www.facebook.com/groups/496677353748745/)** -- I co-organize a monthly playtest for realworld games and a yearly festival ([Come Out and Play SF](http://comeoutandplaysf.org)) in SF.  Many of the games presented by others involve just-in-time teamwork, and often they are also about turning nonaffiliated strangers into affiliated groups in some public or semi-public-space venue.
#
#* **Worst Party Ever** -- Since 2011, I've been part of a crew that makes immersive experiences in public space.  Often simple.  Often beautiful.  Sometimes vaguely illegal.  These events are all multi-party markets in interaction and rapport.  They are physical markets, just like a farmer's market, and we have been making adjustments to optimize the emergence of the right audience-member / fulfilling experience transactions.
#
#I've made and tested over 200 group games and theatrical, participatory interventions.  Only a couple dozen are linked here, but I will be slowly filling in the portfolio.  You can also see very news ones on my [rulesets blog](http://jxe-games.tumblr.com/).
#
#
#* **10 Challenges for New Friends** (2013) - Who else is tired of adding new friends on the internet without a good way to get to know them?  I made a challenged-based game for processing new interesting people and getting to know them.  Please feel free to make your own.  [Link](http://edelwax.tumblr.com/post/58978561014/10-challenges-for-new-friends)
#
#* **A Getting-to-know-you card game** (2012) - A simple game where cards dealt prompt successively riskier personal stories.  ([Rules](http://edelwax.tumblr.com/post/31384959456/a-getting-to-know-you-game-using-a-deck-of-cards-and-a))   <span vous="play" topic="GTKY Cards"></span>
#
#* **Various Theater Games and Warmups for Contact Improvisers** (2006) -- [A small booklet](/pdf/scorebook.pdf) for dancers.  <span vous="play" topic="Theater Games"></span>
#


## Tech
#
#* <a id="groundcrew"></a>**Groundcrew** is a realtime teambuilding command console which was used by disaster relief agencies, city halls during snow storms, political and activist campaign coordinators, and field service and field medical companies. [screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7q0o8s921c8kzzi/2up-interagency.pdf) [a review](http://www.rebellionlab.com/2010/03/29/groundcrew-the-first-stage-of-location-based-services/) [video walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FPMGfAenZg)
#
#* I've created software for forming just-in-time opt-in teams with high opt-in rates and high performance.  These have been tested in environments ranging from art museum openings to disaster sites. **Cadre Events** is a mobile web- and sms-based interface for talking groups of people texting in at the same event and funneling them in chatrooms that coordinate group actitivies between strangers.   [screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/90olm7apkfbg374/d4SNqanDFn).  Deployed and refined at events at YBCA, CoAPSF 2011, and at several Occupy Wall Street sites!  Here are [some missions from CoAP](https://hackpad.com/Cadre-Events-missions-from-COAP2011-ZXCE1SjUZ4y)

				A stack of blank index cards goes in the middle of the group.  A timer is set for 10 or more minutes.  Everyone starts with a minute or so in silence, and then they pick up a card and write something that could be done, by one of the other group members, that they think would be interesting for the group.  This instruction is written on a card and placed face down.  After the first minute, everyone balances their time roughly equually between three activities:  (1) looking around and appreciating whatever is happening; (2) picking up a face-down card and performing whatever instruction is written on it; or (3) noticing something else that it would be nice if someone did it, and writing a new instruction on a new card.
