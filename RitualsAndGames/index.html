## Other theater projects and online/offline games

#### Performances and Events

* **Pantheon** - a theater piece for 12 actors that need to be unlocked by the audience.  In *Pantheon*, every actor gets a binder of games to play and stories to exchange with audience members, and makes a secret decision before the show about what kind of presentation from an audience member will wake them from silence.  The binders are being collaboratively written.  [Join us!](https://hackpad.com/PANTHEON-iLG8ZLrtOIu)

* **Northampton Adventure Exchange** (2007) -- Residents of the small town of Northampton, MA filled out an online form where they specified a kind of quality they wanted to have added to their lives.  The choices included "surprise", "peace and quiet", "danger", "challenge", "warmth", etc.  They also reported their schedules.  A massive potluck was held once a week in which 30+ people attempted to pair up people from the database and make adventures for them to go on together which related to their desires.

* **Continuous Play** (2008)&mdash;A performance collaboration with
  choreographer <a href="http://www.inmixedcompany.com/">Maura Donohue</a> in
  which the audience switches from passive to very active performers,
  directed via SMS, over the course of the evening.

#### Online Installations and Games

* **Invoke** (2000)&mdash;
  Web/physical installation.  A gift-exchange community was
  created. Participants were making, hiding, and finding postcards
  in back pages of low-circulation books in the San Francisco
  public library. Each user would enter the call number and page
  of a book within which he or she would like to receive a
  postcard, and within a week another user would place one there.

* **Yenta** - *down for the moment, help me get it back up* - an webapp that watches the twitter public feed for people that feel "bored" or are asking for something from "anyone".  When it finds two people who are both bored at the same time and live near one another, it asks the user if they'd like to suggest something for both people to do together.  This becomes a double @reply introducing the pair.  The user scores a point if their suggestion drives engagement between the two.

## Earlier work



### <a id="conning"></a> Conning People Out of Their Habits <span vous="discuss"></span>

When people discuss the evenings, days, and weeks that make life worth living, they talk about experiences of connection, wonder, teamwork, adventure, etc.  We miss out on opportunities for experiences like these for all kinds of social, economic, and personal reasons.  Our pedestrian and experiential habits form an important class of these obstacles.  A simple way to intervene is to understand the personal habits of navigation and the social codes around navigation (both navigation of architectural/public space and navigation of time options, more generally) that keep people from otherwise-available experiences they would review highly, and to learn to conn people out of these habits.

We use techniques from conn artistry, theme park design, game design, mythmaking, and immersive theatre to interfere with these habits and social codes.




### <a id="connection"></a> Social Software as a Playground for Teamwork and Connection with Strangers <span vous="discuss"</span>

Under what circumstances do strangers come together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Communities) [2](#groundcrew), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

Work at CouchSurfing was especially valuable: we could live-test different preparations and funnels for strangers meeting one another.  We had opportunities to tune profiles (including review copy via review prompts), to tune search and matchmaking algorithms, and to tune the preparatory messages we send to both sides of a homestay before they meet up in person.  The reviews that users post are stories they tell about their experiences, and this gave us wonderful and rapid feedback about our changes.

**Learned**: there are many ways to prepare strangers so as to increase trust, openness, etc.  Tricks like double opt-ins, prompting welcome messages from peers, structuring interactions through a shared experience or task, and a careful ramp-up of intimacy can make 10-100x differences in conversions to positive and connected experiences.

### <a id="lwl"></a> Microeconomics Evaluated in Playground Terms <span vous="discuss"></span>

What are the most fulfilling things that can happen to a person in an evening or a day?  An emotional breakthrough, a breathtaking vista, a playful conversation with a loved one, the resolution of a longstanding logistical or material problem, a return to an aspect of oneself...

The market for these fulfilling experiences is unusual in that provisioning experiences requires unusual insight into and influence over personality and state, and the criteria for consumer search are poorly understood by both consumers and providers.  These goods are all either experience goods or credence goods which means they cannot be selected from a catalogue.

It is instructive to create situations where there are many providers of potentially fullfilling experiences and many consumers, and various attempts to coordinate can be studied and engineered.

**Learned:** There is a certain regularity to the things that emerge as frequently fulfilling in these environments.  [Diagram of Desires and Rapports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlreore5l5rixmx/desires-and-rapports.pdf).  There is also regularity to the information we need about a person in order to address interactions and rapports they will engage in to them, and regularity to the ways that "vendors" of interaction and rapport need to present themselves in order to be browsable and engagable.
