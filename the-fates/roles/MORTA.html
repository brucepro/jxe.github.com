<h1>MORTA</h1><h2>12pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, welcome to Mauer park.  You are a blacksmith God, and your first task is to find something in your environment that you can use to turn on the five spiritual forges which will allow you to build the future and the past.  Please find five things in the park--they could be people or things--and interact with them in some way that turns on the spiritual fire.  Please keep a record of what you do, and take only about 25 minutes for all five, because you'll need to be at Alexanderplatz by 12:45p.
</p>
<h2>12:45pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, book it to near the base of the giant TV tower.  You want to find a kind of hidden location where you can observe the northeast side of the TV tower base without being seen.  Watch for a girl to show up there and drop a flower, near the base.  Wait and eventually you will see another girl pick up the flower.  Follow the second girl without being detected across the plaza.  Take photos of both girls if you can, without them seeing you. Then break off so you can arrive at St. Oberholz by 1:20.
</p>
<h2>1:30pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, boogie over to St. Oberholz.  You're going to need to lie atop someone's table.  Not an empty table, but one with people around it.  You may need to get them to move their coffees and whatnot.  Try to lie atop a table at exactly 1:35p.  Best if it's in the upstairs section.  See what happens.
</p>
<h2>2:20pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, continue to play this game, but leave St. Oberholz by 2:20p.  Continue playing but travel through the city.  You'll need to be in the U Sch√∂nleinstr area by 3:30p.  You have time to walk if you want, playing the game as you go.  Or you could take the U8 and have more time to wander.
</p>
<h2>3:45pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, you are about to meet your sister Nona.  She has been locked in a dungeon for a while and is dispirited.  You're going to need to help her feel loved and cared for.  You'll go alone to the Hidden Institute at Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will lock you in a dungeon with your sister.  Ring the doorbell I guess.
</p>
<p>Your goal is to help probe both of your memories to discover possible meddling in your lives by ealier instances of the fates.  It would be helpful if you would make extended eye contact for a while.  It would be helpful for you both to talk about your parents, and for you to talk about your ex, Zelda, and to ask her about her ex Fabi, who died while she was with him.  Try to encourage her to feel feelings.  There is a question to answer together, which is why did Fabi, Zelda, and each of your four parents live and die?
</p>
<p>Be absolutely certain that sharing and caring is the only thing for the two of you to do together right now.
</p>
<p>This will be hard.  Be loving and slow.  You will have 45 minutes alone and then even more time to process with someone else in the room.  Hugs.  Etc.  Remember that you are with a Goddess.
</p>
<h2>5:10pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, say aloud what you've learned about any life path alterations and walk out through the dungeon door to the outside.
</p>
<h2>5:10pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, walk to Gorli with Decima.  Talk to each other about how you're doing.  You don't have to be there til 6p so take your time.
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to.  
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>MORTA, show Julie your photo.
