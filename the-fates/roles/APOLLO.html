<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>APOLLO</h1><h2>12:20pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, pick up at least a dozen flowers and hide in James Simon Park by 12:10.  Wait for NONA to show up and kneel on the ground and pray.  Let her wait for at least four minutes and then approach her.  As Apollo, come up behind her and announce yourself with the words "Have you identified what you most want?" (after she answers, long pause) "You are now a God."  Ask her what she most wants, give her the flowers ("you'll need these"), and send her towards Aplatz.  Then stride quickly away.
</p>
<h2>2:30pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, look for two of the three fates playing a game in the plaza at Alexanderplatz, near the fountain.  Apollo and Charon will together arrest Nona, the shorter brunette one, and Charon will take her, in custody, to the Hidden Institute.
</p>
<p>Apollo will tell Nona that she's suspected of violating her trust as a Fate by either spinning a life for someone who shouldn't have been brought to life, or by omitting to bring to life someone who should have had a life, or possibly both.  Until this is cleared up she will have to be locked up in a place that neutralizes her powers.  Explain that she may have difficulty remembering her violation because it may have been an earlier human playing the role of Nona, rather than her, but that we hope she will come to recall what happened exactly.
</p>
<p>Her sister Decima is not currently under suspicion and may remain a free and active Fate.
</p>
<p>When Charon leaves with Nona, Apollo will stride quickly away in another direction, as if called.
</p>
<h2>3:30pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, meet the tallest of the three Fates, Decima / Lisa, in a cafe called K-Fetisch.  The closest U8 stop is U Sch√∂nleinstr.  Your job is to look at a table or chart she has made and to help her imagine having a very different life than than the one she currently plans to lead.  At 4:30 you'll both have somewhere else to be.  Apollo should exit quickly away in another direction without saying goodbye.
</p>
<h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, ask Nona about how she feels like a warrior, and paint her face and possibly her body to match.  Ares is the executive director of this operation, and Apollo will be the art director.  Make sure she feels beautiful and strong.  Ares and Hermes have the facepaint.
</p>
<p>Once she is painted, walk with her to Gorlitzer park.  She will listen to a playlist on her headphones.  Walk surrounding her, as if she is royalty or a bride, and you are her bridesmaids or courtiers.
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.  Use <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/joe_edelman/playlist/1bv1s8hflYPSO3Km1wS1X0">this playlist</a> if you have spotify.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>APOLLO, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
</p><p><i>I hope all went well. Message me a photo of the cuddles, please. -- Zeus</i></p>
