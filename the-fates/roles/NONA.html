<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>NONA</h1><h2>12pm</h2>
<p>NONA, arrive at Lustgarten by 11:50a and find the others on the steps of the Berliner Dom, near the corner furthest from Scholsspl.  With them, you'll sneak up on Lisa and give her one or two kisses, without talking, and then leave the group and head north to James Simon Park across the river.  You should leave the Lustgarten area by 12:10.  Also take a quick photo of Lisa, blindfolded, if you can.
</p>
<h2>12:20pm</h2>
<p>NONA, Head to James Simon Park, by crossing past the cathedral and taking a left on Spreepromenade and Burgstr.  When you get there, kneel on the ground in a prayer position, close your eyes, and see if you can decide what your strongest lasting desire in life is.  (Not your desire for the moment, but your desire for all of life.)  Someone will approach you after 5-10 minutes kneeling.
</p>
<h2>12:45pm</h2>
<p>NONA, you should now have some flowers.  Walk up to the base of the TV tower and drop a flower in the northeast side (the side facing the rest of aplatz).  Your task is to make a chain of flowers that LISA will be able to follow to find you.  You can leave some on the ground, but ideally Lisa will have to interact with people along the way, so maybe you can give a flower or two to vendors along the way.  The flowers should lead her to the north side of aplatz, near or past the fountain, where the two of you will play a game when she finds you.
</p>
<h2>1:30pm</h2>
<p>NONA, you are going to play a game with your sister.  DECIMA has <a href="../menu.pdf">a PDF called "The Menu"</a>.  Take turns choosing from this menu.  The ASKER will ask to learn about something by pointing at it, or to have an experience by naming a type of experience, and so on.  Her sister's job is to tell her about the thing she points at, to lead her towards the type of experience she asks for, etc.  NONA gets to ask for three things and then the roles switch and DECIMA asks for three things.  Repeat.
</p>
<p>After playing for 30 minutes, spend a few minutes considering whether asking for what you're really interested in is the best experience for both people, or whether it is better to not ask for what you really want. Then continue playing.
</p>
<p>Make your way back towards the fountain at Aplatz by about 2:30p and keep playing in the plaza.
</p>
<h2>2:30pm</h2>
<p>NONA, someone will approach you while you're playing with your sister.  Do whatever they say.
</p>
<h2>5:10pm</h2>
<p>NONA, say aloud what you've learned about any life path alterations and walk out through the dungeon door to the outside.
</p>
<h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>NONA, where Weigandufer meets Fuldastr there is a grassy area near the canal.  Go there and find Apollo, Ares, and Hermes waiting for you.
</p>
<h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>NONA, when you head out, listen to <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/1429935565/105360819">this playlist</a>
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>NONA, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>NONA, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>NONA, show Lisa your photo.
</p><p><i>I hope all went well. Message me a photo of the cuddles, please. -- Zeus</i></p>
