<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>MUSES</h1><h2>6pm</h2>
<p>MUSES, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.  Use <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/joe_edelman/playlist/1bv1s8hflYPSO3Km1wS1X0">this playlist</a> if you have spotify.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>MUSES, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
