<h1>CHARON</h1><h2>12pm</h2>
<p>CHARON, arrive at Lustgarten by 11:50a and find the others and hide.  Watch for Lisa to arrive in Lustgarten, and to sit at a bench and put her blindfold on.  Then sneak up next to her and give her several kisses, all over her body, her neck, her face.  Don't talk, do it silently.  Kiss her for five minutes or so and then run away and leave her sitting in the park alone. Make sure you are all out of site before she takes off her blindfold.  Hermes, silently pick up the feathers and the facepaint next to Lisa on the bench.
</p>
<h2>2:30pm</h2>
<p>CHARON, look for two of the three fates playing a game in the plaza at Alexanderplatz, near the fountain.  Apollo and Charon will together arrest Nona, the shorter brunette one, and Charon will take her, in custody, to the Hidden Institute.
</p>
<p>Apollo will tell Nona that she's suspected of violating her trust as a Fate by either spinning a life for someone who shouldn't have been brought to life, or by omitting to bring to life someone who should have had a life, or possibly both.  Until this is cleared up she will have to be locked up in a place that neutralizes her powers.  Explain that she may have difficulty remembering her violation because it may have been an earlier human playing the role of Nona, rather than her, but that we hope she will come to recall what happened exactly.
</p>
<p>Her sister Decima is not currently under suspicion and may remain a free and active Fate.
</p>
<p>Charon will take Nona to the Hidden Institute by riding the U8 with her to U Sch√∂nleinstr and then walking along the canal to Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will lock her in a dungeon.  Make sure to check out the Hidden Institute plaque at the front of the building.
</p>
<h2>3:15pm</h2>
<p>CHARON, ring the doorbell or otherwise get in touch with Cerberus, who will lock up Nona.
