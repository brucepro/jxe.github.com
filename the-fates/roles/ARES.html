<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>ARES</h1><h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>ARES, ask Nona about how she feels like a warrior, and paint her face and possibly her body to match.  Ares is the executive director of this operation, and Apollo will be the art director.  Make sure she feels beautiful and strong.  Ares and Hermes have the facepaint.
</p>
<p>Once she is painted, walk with her to Gorlitzer park.  She will listen to a playlist on her headphones.  Walk surrounding her, as if she is royalty or a bride, and you are her bridesmaids or courtiers.
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>ARES, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.  Use <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/joe_edelman/playlist/1bv1s8hflYPSO3Km1wS1X0">this playlist</a> if you have spotify.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>ARES, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
</p>
