<h1>ARES</h1><h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>ARES, ask Nona about how she feels like a warrior, and paint her face and possibly her body to match.  Ares is the executive director of this operation, and Apollo will be the art director.  Make sure she feels beautiful and strong.  Ares and Hermes have the facepaint.
</p>
<p>Once she is painted, walk with her to Gorlitzer park.  Walk around her as if she is royalty or a bride and you are her bridesmaids or courtiers.
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>ARES, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>ARES, form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to.
