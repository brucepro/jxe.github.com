<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>DECIMA</h1><h2>12pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, try to enter the Lustgarten park quickly and without looking around too much.  Approach a bench, sit, and put your blindfold on.  Once you've placed your blindfold, just wait.  There's no need to speak or to move around. You will be seated for about 20 minutes.  Someone will come and touch you.  Please wait at least 5 minutes afterwards before you take off your blindfold and check for your next instruction.
</p>
<h2>12:55pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, you should have quite a while to walk towards Alexanderplatz.  As you head in that direction, practice your new godhood by imagining how long each pedestrian around you will live.  Imagine that you are responsible for getting the length of their life, and the timing of the major events of their lives, exactly right.  If you like, ask them how long they want to live.  Do not arrive at the base until 12:55p and when you arrive, try to find a flower on the ground.  Follow a trail of flowers until you find your sister. You might have to ask some vendors or people nearby if they have a flower for you.
</p>
<h2>1:30pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, you are going to play a game with your sister.  DECIMA has a printout / PDF called "The Menu".  Take turns.  The ASKER will ask to learn about something by pointing at it, or to have an experience by naming a type of experience, and so on.  Her sister's job is to tell her about the thing she points at, to lead her towards the type of experience she asks for, etc.  NONA gets to ask for three things and then the roles switch and DECIMA asks for three things.  Repeat.
</p>
<p>After playing for 30 minutes, spend a few minutes considering whether asking for what you're really interested in is the best experience for both people, or whether it is better to not ask for what you really want. Then continue playing.
</p>
<p>Make your way back towards the fountain at Aplatz by about 2:30p and keep playing in the plaza.
</p>
<h2>2:30pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, someone will approach your sister and will leave with her.  That's okay.  You will head right away to St. Oberholz and start a data visualization project there, alone.  You are gathering data from the people at the cafe which will help you do your job as a fate, and will be interacting with strangers for 30 minutes or so.  Later you will walk through your results with another God, so keep a good record.
</p>
<p>Your task is to collect some information from the people at St. Oberholz who are older than 26.  (1) What were their lives like when they were 26?  (2) What were their lives like when they were 36?
</p>
<p>If you can think of a nice way to visualize this information that's great.  Otherwise a table is fine.  Please annotate it with guesses as to whether (1) you would enjoy such a life as they had at that point, or (2) one of your friends would.
</p>
<p>Please try to collect information from more than five people in the time you have allotted.  The more the better.
</p>
<h2>3:30pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, go to K-Fetisch.  The closest U8 stop is U Sch√∂nleinstr.  You will be approached by a God.
</p>
<h2>4:30pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, you are about to meet your two sisters.  They have been locked in a dungeon for a while and you will co-counsel with them both before leading them out.  Go alone to the Hidden Institute at Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will bring you to the dungeon.  Ring the doorbell.  Notice the plaque on the way in.
</p>
<p>Please lead a three way co-counseling session with your two sisters.  But it's not equal.  Give Nona time if she needs it, but give Morta extra time.  Your sister Morta needs to feel out a feeling that's been locked within him for many many years.  This feeling is DESPERATION/DESPERATENESS/HOPELESSNESS/LUST.  See if you and your sister Nona can create a situation in which Morta can feel this feeling for 10-15 minutes at least.  Suggest gestures and sounds and so on that will help Morta feel this emotion.
</p>
<h2>5:10pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, say aloud what you've learned about any life path alterations and walk out through the dungeon door to the outside.
</p>
<h2>5:10pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, walk to Gorli with Morta.  Talk to each other about how you're doing.  You don't have to be there til 6p so take your time.  Listen to <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/1429935565/105360819">this playlist</a>
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>DECIMA, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
</p>
