<h1>CERBERUS</h1><h2>3:15pm</h2>
<p>CERBERUS, put a candle, some art supplies, some water, and a snack in the dungeon room and lock Nona in it when Charon brings her to you.  I think they'll ring the doorbell.  Please also put a sign in there that says "You'll be here for a long time."  This can just be written on a post-it note.  Thanks!
</p>
<h2>3:45pm</h2>
<p>CERBERUS, someone else will arrive.  Please lock him in the dungeon with Nona.
</p>
<h2>4:30pm</h2>
<p>CERBERUS, your last dungeon guest will arrive.  Put her in the dungeon, but this time leave the door a little open.  They will let themselves out at around 5:10p.  You don't need to worry about it.
