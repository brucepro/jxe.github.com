<p><i>Your day has come. May the Gods smile upon you!  Call Apollo  (+33 7 52 67 47 24) or Hermes (+4917623734859) if there's an emergency. -- Zeus</i></p>
<h1>HERMES</h1><h2>12pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, arrive at Lustgarten by 11:50a and find the others and hide.  Watch for Lisa to arrive in Lustgarten, and to sit at a bench and put her blindfold on.  Then sneak up next to her and give her several kisses, all over her body, her neck, her face.  Don't talk, do it silently.  Kiss her for five minutes or so and then run away and leave her sitting in the park alone. Make sure you are all out of site before she takes off her blindfold.  Hermes, silently pick up the feathers and the facepaint next to Lisa on the bench.
</p>
<h2>1:30pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, arrive at St. Oberholz by 1:20p and wait around in the upstairs section.  At 1:35p MORTA will lie atop someone else's table. Give MORTA at least a minute to lie on the table with nothing happening.  It should be a little awkward.  Then approach.  You should speak like a God, which means unnaturally slower, impossibly confident, and maintaining eye contact whenever you are speaking.  Practice it beforehand.  Tell MORTA that, to train him to be a God, you will play a game where he invents a "command" which captures a desire he has for what other people in the cafe will do, and you and your assistant will attempt to lead the people in the cafe to do whatever he commands.  He shouldn't have arbitrary commands, but should command things that he actually desires.  Play this game for about 30 minutes.
</p>
<h2>2:20pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, continue to play this game, but leave St. Oberholz by 2:20p.  Continue playing but travel through the city.  You'll need to be in the U Sch√∂nleinstr area by 3:30p.  You have time to walk if you want, playing the game as you go.  Or you could take the U8 and have more time to wander.
</p>
<h2>2:20pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, encourage Morta to try out more sexual or inappropriate desires.
</p>
<h2>5:15pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, ask Nona about how she feels like a warrior, and paint her face and possibly her body to match.  Ares is the executive director of this operation, and Apollo will be the art director.  Make sure she feels beautiful and strong.  Ares and Hermes have the facepaint.
</p>
<p>Once she is painted, walk with her to Gorlitzer park.  She will listen to a playlist on her headphones.  Walk surrounding her, as if she is royalty or a bride, and you are her bridesmaids or courtiers.
</p>
<h2>6pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.  Use <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/joe_edelman/playlist/1bv1s8hflYPSO3Km1wS1X0">this playlist</a> if you have spotify.
</p>
<h2>6:45pm</h2>
<p>HERMES, end by reading the following quote, and then form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to:
</p>
<p>"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you."
