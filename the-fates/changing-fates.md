# Changing Fates

25 April 2015 CEDT




## Scene: Fire the Forges

12pm

MORTA, welcome to Mauer park.  You are a blacksmith God, and your first task is to find something in your environment that you can use to turn on the five spiritual forges which will allow you to build the future and the past.  Please find five things in the park--they could be people or things--and interact with them in some way that turns on the spiritual fire.  Please keep a record of what you do, and take only about 25 minutes for all five, because you'll need to be at Alexanderplatz by 12:45p.



## Scene: Blindfold kisses

12pm

DECIMA, try to enter the Lustgarten park quickly and without looking around too much.  Approach a bench, sit, and put your blindfold on.  Once you've placed your blindfold, just wait.  There's no need to speak or to move around. You will be seated for about 20 minutes.  Someone will come and touch them.  Please wait at least 5 minutes afterwards before you take off your blindfold and check for your next instruction.

NONA, arrive at Lustgarten by 11:50a and find the others and hide.  You will give Lisa one or two kisses, without talking, and then leave the group and head north to James Simon Park across the river.  You should leave the rest of the group by 12:10.  Also take a quick photo of Lisa, blindfolded, if you can.

HERMES/CHARON, arrive at Lustgarten by 11:50a and find the others and hide.  Watch for Lisa to arrive in Lustgarten, and to sit at a bench and put her blindfold on.  Then sneak up next to her and give her several kisses, all over her body, her neck, her face.  Don't talk, do it silently.  Kiss her for five minutes or so and then run away and leave her sitting in the park alone. Make sure you are all out of site before she takes off her blindfold.  Hermes, silently pick up the feathers and the facepaint next to Lisa on the bench.




## Scene: Kneel

12:20pm

APOLLO, pick up at least a dozen flowers and hide in James Simon Park by 12:10.  Wait for NONA to show up and kneel on the ground and pray.  Let her wait for at least four minutes and then approach her.  As Apollo, come up behind her and announce yourself with the words "Have you identified what you most want?" (after she answers, long pause) "You are now a God."  Ask her what she most wants, give her the flowers ("you'll need these"), and send her towards Aplatz.

NONA, Head to James Simon Park, by crossing past the cathedral and taking a left on Spreepromenade and Burgstr.  When you get there, kneel on the ground in a prayer position, close your eyes, and see if you can decide what your strongest lasting desire in life is.  (Not your desire for the moment, but your desire for all of life.)  Someone will approach you after 5-10 minutes kneeling.




## Scene: Flowers

12:45pm.

MORTA, book it to near the base of the giant TV tower.  You want to find a kind of hidden location where you can observe the northeast side of the TV tower base without being seen.  Watch for a girl to show up there and drop a flower, near the base.  Wait and eventually you will see another girl pick up the flower.  Follow the second girl without being detected across the plaza.  Take photos of both girls if you can, without them seeing you. Then break off so you can arrive at St. Oberholz by 1:20.

NONA, you should now have some flowers.  Walk up to the base of the TV tower and drop a flower in the northeast side (the side facing the rest of aplatz).  Your task is to make a chain of flowers that LISA will be able to follow to find you.  You can leave some on the ground, but ideally Lisa will have to interact with people along the way, so maybe you can give a flower or two to vendors along the way.  The flowers should lead her to the north side of aplatz, near or past the fountain, where the two of you will play a game when she finds you.



12:55pm

DECIMA, you should have quite a while to walk towards Alexanderplatz.  As you head in that direction, practice your new godhood by imagining how long each pedestrian around you will live.  Imagine that you are responsible for getting the length of their life, and the timing of the major events of their lives, exactly right.  If you like, ask them how long they want to live.  Do not arrive at the base until 12:55p and when you arrive, try to find a flower on the ground.  Follow a trail of flowers until you find your sister. You might have to ask some vendors or people nearby if they have a flower for you.




## Scene: Mentorship

1:30pm.

NONA/DECIMA, you are going to play a game with your sister.  DECIMA has a printout / PDF called "The Menu".  Take turns.  The ASKER will ask to learn about something by pointing at it, or to have an experience by naming a type of experience, and so on.  Her sister's job is to tell her about the thing she points at, to lead her towards the type of experience she asks for, etc.  NONA gets to ask for three things and then the roles switch and DECIMA asks for three things.  Repeat.

After playing for 30 minutes, spend a few minutes considering whether asking for what you're really interested in is the best experience for both people, or whether it is better to not ask for what you really want. Then continue playing.

Make your way back towards the fountain at Aplatz by about 2:30p and keep playing in the plaza.



## Scene: Taking the Crown

1:30pm

MORTA, boogie over to St. Oberholz.  You're going to need to lie atop someone's table.  Not an empty table, but one with people around it.  You may need to get them to move their coffees and whatnot.  Try to lie atop a table at exactly 1:35p.  Best if it's in the upstairs section.  See what happens.

HERMES, arrive at St. Oberholz by 1:20p and wait around in the upstairs section.  At 1:35p MORTA will lie atop someone else's table. Give MORTA at least a minute to lie on the table with nothing happening.  It should be a little awkward.  Then approach.  You should speak like a God, which means unnaturally slower, impossibly confident, and maintaining eye contact whenever you are speaking.  Practice it beforehand.  Tell MORTA that, to train him to be a God, you will play a game where he invents a "command" which captures a desire he has for what other people in the cafe will do, and you and your assistant will attempt to lead the people in the cafe to do whatever he commands.  He shouldn't have arbitrary commands, but should command things that he actually desires.  Play this game for about 30 minutes.



## Scene: Going Commando

2:20pm.

MORTA/HERMES, continue to play this game, but leave St. Oberholz by 2:20p.  Continue playing but travel through the city.  You'll need to be in the U Schönleinstr area by 3:30p.  You have time to walk if you want, playing the game as you go.  Or you could take the U8 and have more time to wander.

HERMES, encourage Morta to try out more sexual or inappropriate desires.





## Scene:  Arrested

2:30pm.

NONA, someone will approach you while you're playing with your sister.  Do whatever they say.

APOLLO/CHARON, look for two of the three fates playing a game in the plaza at Alexanderplatz, near the fountain.  Apollo and Charon will together arrest Nona, the shorter brunette one, and Charon will take her, in custody, to the Hidden Institute.

Apollo will tell Nona that she's suspected of violating her trust as a Fate by either spinning a life for someone who shouldn't have been brought to life, or by omitting to bring to life someone who should have had a life, or possibly both.  Until this is cleared up she will have to be locked up in a place that neutralizes her powers.  Explain that she may have difficulty remembering her violation because it may have been an earlier human playing the role of Nona, rather than her, but that we hope she will come to recall what happened exactly.

Her sister Decima is not currently under suspicion and may remain a free and active Fate.

Charon will take Nona to the Hidden Institute by riding the U8 with her to U Schönleinstr and then walking along the canal to Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will lock her in a dungeon.  Make sure to check out the Hidden Institute plaque at the front of the building.



## Scene:  Gathering Life Paths

2:30pm.

DECIMA, someone will approach your sister and will leave with her.  That's okay.  You will head right away to St. Oberholz and start a data visualization project there, alone.  You are gathering data from the people at the cafe which will help you do your job as a fate, and will be interacting with strangers for 30 minutes or so.  Later you will walk through your results with another God, so keep a good record.

Your task is to collect some information from the people at St. Oberholz who are older than 26.  (1) What were their lives like when they were 26?  (2) What were their lives like when they were 36?

If you can think of a nice way to visualize this information that's great.  Otherwise a table is fine.  Please annotate it with guesses as to whether (1) you would enjoy such a life as they had at that point, or (2) one of your friends would.

Please try to collect information from more than five people in the time you have allotted.  The more the better.




## Scene:  Imprisoned

3:15pm.

CERBERUS, put a candle, some art supplies, some water, and a snack in the dungeon room and lock Nona in it when Charon brings her to you.  I think they'll ring the doorbell.  Please also put a sign in there that says "You'll be here for a long time."  This can just be written on a post-it note.  Thanks!

CHARON, ring the doorbell or otherwise get in touch with Cerberus, who will lock up Nona.



## Scene:  Life Paths Discussion

3:30pm.

APOLLO, meet the tallest of the three Fates, Decima / Lisa, in a cafe called K-Fetisch.  The closest U8 stop is U Schönleinstr.  Your job is to look at a table or chart she has made and to help her imagine having a very different life than than the one she currently plans to lead.

DECIMA, go to K-Fetisch.  The closest U8 stop is U Schönleinstr.  You will be approached by a God.



## Scene:  Confiding

3:45pm

MORTA, you are about to meet your sister Nona.  She has been locked in a dungeon for a while and is dispirited.  You're going to need to help her feel loved and cared for.  You'll go alone to the Hidden Institute at Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will lock you in a dungeon with your sister.  Ring the doorbell I guess.

Your goal is to help probe both of your memories to discover possible meddling in your lives by ealier instances of the fates.  It would be helpful if you would make extended eye contact for a while.  It would be helpful for you both to talk about your parents, and for you to talk about your ex, Zelda, and to ask her about her ex Fabi, who died while she was with him.  Try to encourage her to feel feelings.  There is a question to answer together, which is why did Fabi, Zelda, and each of your four parents live and die?

Be absolutely certain that sharing and caring is the only thing for the two of you to do together right now.

This will be hard.  Be loving and slow.  You will have 45 minutes alone and then even more time to process with someone else in the room.  Hugs.  Etc.  Remember that you are with a Goddess.

CERBERUS, someone else will arrive.  Please lock him in the dungeon with Nona.



## Scene:  Reunion

4:30pm.

DECIMA, you are about to meet your two sisters.  They have been locked in a dungeon for a while and you will co-counsel with them both before leading them out.  Go alone to the Hidden Institute at Weigandufer 28, back house, 1st floor, where you'll meet Cerberus who will bring you to the dungeon.  Ring the doorbell.  Notice the plaque on the way in.

Please lead a three way co-counseling session with your two sisters.  But it's not equal.  Give Nona time if she needs it, but give Morta extra time.  Your sister Morta needs to feel out a feeling that's been locked within him for many many years.  This feeling is DESPERATION/DESPERATENESS/HOPELESSNESS/LUST.  See if you and your sister Nona can create a situation in which Morta can feel this feeling for 10-15 minutes at least.  Suggest gestures and sounds and so on that will help Morta feel this emotion.

CERBERUS, your last dungeon guest will arrive.  Put her in the dungeon, but this time leave the door a little open.  They will let themselves out at around 5:10p.  You don't need to worry about it.


5:10pm

DECIMA/NONA/MORTA, say aloud what you've learned about any life path alterations and walk out through the dungeon door to the outside.



## Scene:  Recovery

5:10pm.

DECIMA, walk to Gorli with Morta.  Talk to each other about how you're doing.  You don't have to be there til 6p so take your time.

MORTA, walk to Gorli with Decima.  Talk to each other about how you're doing.  You don't have to be there til 6p so take your time.




## Scene:  Warrior prep

5:15pm.

NONA, where Weigandufer meets Fuldastr there is a grassy area near the canal.  Go there and find Apollo, Ares, and Hermes waiting for you.

APOLLO/HERMES/ARES, ask Nona about how she feels like a warrior, and paint her face and possibly her body to match.  Ares is the executive director of this operation, and Apollo will be the art director.  Make sure she feels beautiful and strong.  Ares and Hermes have the facepaint.

Once she is painted, walk with her to Gorlitzer park.  Walk around her as if she is royalty or a bride and you are her bridesmaids or courtiers.



## Scene:  March to the Senses

6pm.

APOLLO/HERMES/MUSES/ARES, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.  Distribute the feathers.  One by one, invite the fates into the middle of the circle, have them close their eyes, and have them dance, and tickle them with the feathers.  Tickle the parts of their bodies that aren't dancing, to remind them to use all parts of their bodies when they are dancing.  If it feels right, they can later all dance together.

NONA/DECIMA/MORTA, go to the top of the terraced rock hill that people sit on, across from Das Edelweiss, the little restaurant.


6:45pm.

NONA/DECIMA/MORTA/APOLLO/HERMES/MUSES/ARES, form a cuddle pile with whomever else wants to.  

NONA, show Lisa your photo.

MORTA, show Julie your photo.
