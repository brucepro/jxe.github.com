## Abstract

<p id="abstract">
*Considering the information requirements of choosing, current on-device menus are found to be inadequate, untrustworthy, isolating, and biased toward regrettable choices.  To address this, I'll suggest principles for the redesign of browers, app stores, recommenders, notifications, and other menu systems, as well as a public data repository about the outcomes of various choices.  Finally, I'll discuss potential impacts on the media ecosystem and on incentives for business.*

## Our Situation

### Untrustworthy Technology

If doctors have responsibilities to their patients--to help them make informed choices, to present infrormation in an unbiased way, and to act in their best interests rather than exploiting them--might we say that our computing devices (and the companies that produce them) have a similar set of responsibilities to us?

Here we'll focus on one key responsibility:  the responsibility to present the best options in the best ways, rather than using biased menus to manipulate the user.  And we'll devise systems and institutions that would allow devices to live up to this one responsibility.

Currently, many other kinds of device menus--including app stores, notification screens, browsers--are guilty of two broad kinds of manipulation:

**Hidden costs**--for instance, when a sketchy bank charges unexpected fees--are considered *dishonest* in business.  But unexpected *time costs* on the internet are widespread and not yet seen as dishonest.

<div class="sidenote">
What if time costs were estimated for everything?
</div>

<img src="img/fb-read-time.png" class="zoomed">

**False promises**--for instance, when a salesman misleads us about the promise of a product--are also considered dishonest.  We call such a salesman a *charlatan* or a *quack*.  But when an app store sells a fitness app or a dating app without providing information about other options and how they work out for people, we don't yet blame the app store.

This paper takes the position that menus should serve users. Since humans tend to choose from what's in front of us, it follows that these menus that are so often in front of us, these have a great influence on our lives.  It's vital that we bring them into line.   At the platform level, devices must take care to populate menus with options aligned with the users' interests--rather than in the interests of increasing engagement metrics for media companies--and should present those options in a way that (a) lets us choose well, (b) let's us express what's important to us, and (c) doesn't isolate us in the process.

In other words, we want menus that help us make informed, expressive, and social choices.  Below, I suggest that the key to designing such menus is to understand (a) how our situation affects our choices, (b) how our choices shape our identities, and (c) what kinds of choices our devices can and should help us with.

## Human choicemaking

### Choicemaking and Finding Better Options

*"The sea is endless when you are in a rowboat."* -- Casares

A person's situation is a key factor in whether they find options.

An exhausted worker who comes home and switches on the TV, a tourist who goes to McDonald's because they can't figure out which local places are good, a woman who buys a donut as a snack when she'd prefer a mozerella and tomato hors'dvoer but doesn't know where to find one--these we can call *desperate choices*.  They can be considered rational choices, but they are made based of the disparity of search costs, not because of a preference indepenedent of search costs.  For a society, they can be an indication of a failing. &#10033;  <div class="sidenote">&#10033; To the extent that coordination is an information and search problem, even the choice to do isolated activities instead of meeting with friends is of this type.  For instance, the choice to use internet porn over having a relationship likely is more about search costs than about independent preferences or non-search transaction costs. </div>

The economics literature suggests that even the most hardcore addictions are best thought of as desperate choices.  While in popular culture and psychology addiction is usually regarded as a kind of impairment of the ability to choose (e.g., "OMG I just spent 4 hours on facebook."), economsts tend to think of it as either (a) a rational choice made with a misunderstanding (e.g., "I thought I could spend just a few minutes!" or "I thought it'd make me popular and happy!"), or as (b) a rational choice made in a bad situation (e.g., "Life sucks lets get high and watch cat videos.").

These interpretations were advanced in [a landmark paper by Becker and Murphy](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1830469?uid=3737864&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21104100113327) which found that cigarette smoking and heroin use are sensitive both to announcements of future tax levels and to independent improvements in life circumstances.  That is, people do stop doing heroin when they suddenly have an unexpected chance to go to college, and they can stop smoking if they figure out it's going to be more expensive than they thought.  I.e., if they recalculate the direct costs or opportunity costs.

This suggests that a regrettable choice is not a character defect, a failure to choose, or a weird preference, but a lack of options at  hand--a lack of better options with low search costs.  The activities we regret are the ones where we know we could have done better by ourselves (at least if we had known), but the search for better options was too hard at the time.

It follows that interventions that deprive an addict of their drug--browsing "speedbumps", prohibitions, etc--will not be as effective as providing better situations for people and better opportunities at the moment of choice.

Television, the Internet, and now mobile phones have dramatically lowered the search costs for certain kinds of entertainment, mostly isolating entertainment, effectively subsidizing them relative to other ways we can use our time that we might prefer, were they easier to discover.

These subsidies affect us most strongly when we are tired, absent-minded, time poor, and alone.  These are situations where it's most important to surface information that will help with search.


<a name='life-in-review'></a>

### Choicemaking and Information Requirements

*"Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, 'It might have been.'"* -- Kurt Vonnegut

But what information in particular is important to guide search, and where can we draw the line for what we can demand we be shown in relation to choices?

In what follows, we'll describe what it would mean for a device to make a *best effort* to help us *live well* according to *our own judgement*.

The idea is that, when there is information that would help us live better according to our own judgement and values, we would like our devices to surface it promptly and at the moment of choice.

Conversely, if a device leads us, through omitting easily-obtainable information, to do something we would regret on review, then we may say it has tricked us and prevented us from choosing well.

To be clear, avoiding *feeling* of regret is not the standard here.  Firstly, we may feel regret about an action even when we were fully informed going into it.  Secondly, we sometimes don't feel regret simply because we haven't had the opportunity to review our activity.

For this reason, we'll focus on designing interfaces that avoid *regrettable choices*--choices we would regret if we were to review our activity--and specifically the subset that we might call *"I wish I had known" regrettable choices*. &#10033;<span class="sidenote">&#10033; A full explanation of why "I-Wish-I-Had-Known Regret" (IWIHKR) is a good foundation for defining good and bad choices is beyond our scope here.  But consider that, in choosing a metric around which to characterise choices, we would want one that: (a) accommodates many value systems across different users, (b) aligns with user intuitions about what's good, and (c) aligns with human needs.  An inferior metric like "maximal moment-to-moment happiness" fails all of these:  some people don't value happiness, many things widely regarded to be good like grad school and childbirth are not about happiness, and there are ways to be happy that don't align well with human needs.  Furthermore: (d) IWIHKR is clearly and quickly evaluable via user reports, (e) that evaluation once made is durable over time, and (f) minimizing IWIHKR correlates well with existing metrics, including maximizing brand trust and net promoter, maximizing positive user sentiment, and minimizing burnout.</span>

Shitty menus lead us directly to these regrettable choices.  Shitty menus may be missing information about time costs, money costs, whether hoped-for outcomes are likely, whether unexpected outcomes are likely, whether there are less-costly or otherwise better options for similar outcomes, and even whether our hopes themselves are likely to change.  Without this information, it is more likely we'll make a choice we'll later regret.

Below I'll present designs for browsers, for app stores, and for other device menus that can do better.

<a name='expressive-choice'></a>

### Choicemaking and Identity

*"There are goals other than well-being, and values other than goals."* - Amartya
Sen, 1984

While one source of regret is about ignorance of better options and hidden costs, another involves situations where our goals or values themselves were misinformed or otherwise immature.  Sometimes a goal was overly specific, was dependent on some other goal in a way we didn't understand, was founded on a misunderstanding, or was just inferior to another goal or value we hadn't thought of.

<div class="sidenote">
In this map, an arrow is drawn when people tend to migrate from one activity to another activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively.
</div>

<img src="img/activities.png" class="zoomed">

Philosopher Ruth Chang has explored what happens when we have an initial difficulty making a choice--when we are stalled because one option seems better in some ways, and another better in a different way.  She says these are the moments where we reexamine and change our values.  We often choose *a new value* for ourselves that makes the choice clear. &#10033; <div class="sidenote"> &#10033;  This is the opposite of flipping a coin. </div>

This activity of self-construction happens only in environments of *expressive choice*.  It's desirable for users to be able to explore a space (or neighborhood) of values that might apply to a choice, and to organize *what's in front of them* in terms of *what matters to them*.  As simple a thing as providing widgets for changing the sort order and filtering of options creates more possibility for expressive choice.

If menus are to surface information for making decisions we won't regret, they must let us explore what's important to us about the options, and navigate according to what's important to us once we know.



<a name="repair"></a><a name='promises'></a>

## Repairing individual choicemaking

### Revealing Promises

*"Ads sell a great deal more than products. They sell values, images, and concepts of success and worth."* -- Brene Brown

Most of the information for good choicemaking depends on the users' hopes.  If we choose to engage with a resource--to go to an event, to use an app, to buy a product, to follow a link, etc--it's because we have a hope, because we are taken with the *promise* of the engagement.  This promise could be the *outcome* we hope will result, it could be a *value* embodied in the choice itself, or it could be an outcome we wish to avoid.  &#10033;  <div class="sidenote">&#10033;  Our everyday hopes, as we buy things, download apps, book appointments, etc--are few enough that they can all be clearly named. While human pursuits in general are of infinite variety, the key categories for everyday life are: (a) terms related to ideal schedules (e.g. "frequent exercise"), (b) ideal personal states (e.g. "getting hitched"), and (c) ideal tactics (e.g., "acting boldly").</div>

We may, for instance, think of facebook as good for a quick break, or of Sports Authority as a way to getting fat, or of signing up for voice lessons as a courageous move.  We can give each such hope a name and use an on-screen object to help the user navigate according to what they're really after.

#### Example: Browsing

Most of us have visited facebook.com at some point during work when we needed a break.

<img src="img/gmail-w-lozenge-and-border.jpg" class="zoomed">

Let's say we were trying to get organized in Gmail when we decide we need a break.  We don't want to think very hard about what to do, so we type 'f' into the box at the top of the window.  We lack the time or the energy to make an internal catalogue of options for a break.

In today's browsers, there is no representation of what I want or of how much time I want to spend.  I'm hoping to relax, to take a break, perhaps imagining it will take 5 minutes.  But nowhere on the screen do the words "break" or "relax" or "5 minutes" appear.  It's as though the device wants me to forget my plans.

A more user-aligned browser would make this explicit.  For instance, with an extra tag in the URL bar to capture what the use of the site is about.

Once I start navigating to facebook, of course there could be many reasons I'd want to go there.

<img src="img/chrome-f.jpg" class="zoomed">

Here, I can compare how well these uses of facebook have worked out for people.  And I can see--maybe for the first time--if there might be a better activity for feeling relaxed.

<img src="img/fb-w-lozenge-and-border.jpg" class="zoomed">
<img src="img/fb-w-lozenge-and-popup.jpg" class="zoomed">


#### Example: Shopping

Of course the same can work for physical goods:

<img src="img/amazon-warning.png" class="zoomed">




<!--
#### Prior art

The closest thing to a standard for conveying benefits are the [highlighted phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation) pulled out of reviews by Yelp, Amazon, and Google.

<img src="img/yelp.png" class="zoomed">

The phrases capture *features* of a product or service, like "great view" and "mozarella sticks", but they don't capture our actual hopes, which are both more general and more specific--things like "quality time with friends", "an adventurous weekend", "feeling refreshed", "getting fit", or "learning to knit".

<a name="neighborhoods"></a>
### Neighborhoods of Promise

*To be written.*

<!--
<img src="img/fb-w-lozenge-and-popup.jpg" class="zoomed">

How do people change their activities as they learn about what's possible or what satisfies them?  When the same user reviews different engagements for a set of desired outcomes, we can answer important questions. In the map below, an arrow is drawn when reviewers tend to migrate from one activity to another activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively, so they stick with it.

<img src="img/activities.png" class="zoomed">

Many such maps are possible, creating an opportunity for data visualizers and storytellers [to map our collective wisdom](/OpenOutcomes/). What do people that want to "be successful" or "get fit" tend to want 6 months or a year later?  Which desires are the most durable--are you making a big choice based on fleeting interests?  What works best for getting fit--apps, gyms, trainers, fitness buddies, or equipment?  What have people tried first and then given up on?

<a name="recommenders"></a>

### Life-aware Recommenders

Algorithmic menus like Facebook Newsfeed and Google Now are even more important to align with our true interests, because they've begun to structure even more of our discretionary time.

*A full treatment of recommnder systems and feeds will come later.*

<a name="beyond"></a>
## Beyond individual choicemaking


<a name='social-choice'></a>

*"Isolation underpins technology, and technology isolates in its turn; all goods proposed by the spectacular system, from cars to televisions, also serve as weapons for that system as it strives to reinforce the isolation of 'the lonely crowd.'"* -- Guy Debord

*"Computers, video, radio, printing presses, synthesizers, fax machines, tape recorders, photocopiers -- these things make great toys, but terrible addictions. Finally we realize that we cannot "reach out and touch someone" who is not present in the flesh."* -- Hakim Bey

### Social Choices

*To be written*

<!--

It appears as though we might decide “I’m going to this event” or “I like this video.”

The playground reveals that our choices are usually provisional, invitational, or suggestive, rather than truly personal. Our choices are actually of the form “I will if you will” or “why don’t we” or “here is an example” or “I’ll join you in” or “this I believe in.”

To choose an activity on the playground is to lead a friend, or to hope for a friend, or to invite a stranger with your mere presence, or perhaps even just to enter into a reverie with some equipment or the landscape. The act of rapport and the act of choice cannot be other than simultaneous and it is a conceit unique to consumerism and our tech landscape that we make choices without realizing each choice is as much a planning of others’ lives as of our own.

On some days we may play with the authors of books or the shapers of landscapes now far away, we very rarely play alone, and even the act of sitting quietly with a book in a public space is an act of leadership or following. The playground lays this bare.

-->

<a name='collective-wisdom'></a>

### Collective wisdom

Returning to the idea that desperate choices stem from a lack of options at hand, let's look at how our media transmit information about new options above the level of individual menus.

The metrics that propel coverage in our media environment currently come from sampling the impulsive, lost moments in people's days.  These are likes/clicks/views/purchases/download stats, and they determine the distribution reach of options via newsfeeds, advertising, virality, and leaderboards.

This means that the options that do well and are widely circulated are more likely to be clicked on, but less likely to be in our long-term interest.  It's not surprising that Upworthy wins the day.  Our collective impulses reach out towards whatever's placed in front of us.

But our impulses are not the only information available.  We can also gather retrospective, thoughtful information from people, and the 5-star reviews common across the web are an example of more thoughtful data that also sometimes drives rankings.

Virality, then, is a symptom of measuring and leveraging data about just one end of people's experience--their impulse to click or download in the first place.  The data we've been talking about--about resources, about which we are glad we engaged with and which we regret, about values, and about changing values--this is retrospective, thoughtful data.  It samples a kind of *collective wisdom*, rather than viral impulse.

If collective wisdom can be used to drive distribution and ranking of options, it will mean better options at hand for most people.  That will mean fewer desperate choices and more lives well lived.



#### Data collection

But how can we gather public data about people, choices, and outcomes?  Well, this is not unlike what product reviews are supposed to do.

![](img/stars.png)

The venerable five-star review--while it guides us better than popularity and virality metrics--doesn't ask about outcomes.  A product like Angry Birds can receive excellent reviews and still be a regretted engagement for many users.  Besides unexpected time costs, someone might have downloaded angry birds to take a relaxing break from work, then later found that they weren't relaxed, or that there was an option that worked better for them for work breaks.  We need a review that will capture all of this.

The task is to remind reviewers of the costs involved in the engagement (time and money, ideally as authenticated via the service provider or the platform), then to give them a quick and articulate way to report what the engagement was *about*, how their desired outcomes have worked out so far, and what else has happened.  Occasionally, they'll need to be explain that an engagement was about something new--an outcome not in our database.

Here's a first attempt at such a retrospective review:

<img src="img/review-markup.png">

It won't take millions of reviews.  But to provide meaningful signals across all the top apps and web products, we will need an articulate, representative, and thoughtful set of reviewers.  Like the Nielsen families we for TV, but collecting a greater range of engagements, and capturing what each of them was about.

If we were to collect a small number (say [50,000](/OpenOutcomes/)) of these reviews, we might have a significant public resource.

<div class="sidenote">
Collective wisdom about outcomes may eventually be a distributed, internet-level concern, below the content and application layers.
</div>

A community resource to answer these questions quantitatively would be consequential.  As a data API, it'd be a google maps or OpenStreetMap for life decisions--augmenting all manner of shopping, browsing, and list experiences, allowing users to sort by likely outcomes, relevancy to their own desires for personal growth or scheduling, etc.

Such an API could be used for everything from labeling and filtering the entries in Facebook Newsfeed that are relevant to your short-term desires, to sourcing and sorting suggestions for friend get-togethers:

<div class="sidenote">
This interface was tested with a few thousand users as part of a defunct startup. The results suggested that user behavior can change significantly when recommendations are ordered by desired outcome and ranked by reported likelihood of an outcome working out.
</div>

<img src="img/bright-ideas-3up.png" class="smaller">

While such a data API could be popular, so would a rendering of the data as a destination and community site. It'd be like Wikipedia [or Quora](http://www.quora.com/Life-Lessons/What-is-the-one-thing-that-people-wish-they-had-known-about-life-when-you-were-in-your-20s-d-2), but focused on life choices made, what they were about for the individuals involved, and how it all worked out.  Visitors could review choices about downloading/using apps, websites, products, etc--but they could also review larger engagements, like moving to a new city, going freelance, etc.

<a name='outcome-economy'></a>

### Best-Outcome Economies

A powerful lens through which to look at the health of an economy is to ask the question: Are the interests of businesses and other providers aligned with those of their customers or users?  To some extent this means checking whether sales and spending figures correlate tightly with long term satisfaction or with things like customers' health or other measurements of well-being.

The epidemics that currently face the modernized countries--obesity, social isolation, depression, a lack of meaningful work, and so on--indicate just such a misalignment.

Our true interests as the "users" of the economy are disturbingly misaligned with the interests of industry and marketing, which focus on clicks, views, downloads, and sales, rather than on our long-term desired outcomes.

Ideally, organizations in an economy would have no economic interest besides positive outcomes for those who engage with their products or services.

<div class="sidenote">
  If we imagine an outcome economy--our society re-gearing around longer-term forms of satisfaction: How would it be different from the consumption economy we have today?  This is consumer spending.

</div>

<img src="img/nytspending.png">


To *outcome-align our society* would require both (a) detecting when and how best our true interests are satisfied, and (b) either reshaping traffic / sales or otherwise changing incentives for businesses and organizations to match those reports of long-term satisfaction.

Even if better menus are insufficient to reshape demand at level required for the latter, the information gathered via retrospective reviews is vital for the former, especially if the engagements described in reviews are verified at the platform level to prevent fraud.

We can then decide as a society how to disincent businesses which lead us into activities we regret because of high costs and bad outcomes.

Finally, we can work towards switching from marketplaces that are mostly about transactions to marketplaces for personal outcomes; directing attention and cashflow towards providers and sites that produce the best outcomes, best likelihoods, and lowest costs in users' lives, rather than those with viral loops, network effects, marketing deals, or other advantages.




## Conclusion

*"We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honor those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well."* -- John Maynard Keynes

In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes claimed that the sales metrics that drive capitalism would at some point start driving us in the wrong direction.  Perhaps that time has come.  Can we measure demand with the question &ldquo;what are you glad that you bought?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;what did you buy?&rdquo;, or online, with &ldquo;what are you glad you clicked?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;what did you click?&rdquo;  Can we tether the lifeblood of our economy--cashflow, attention, and resources--to reports of informed and fulfilled lives?  Would people then work together to create the best outcomes for one another--in much the same way they currently collaborate to generate sales, clicks, and views?



## Summary

* A standard for judging the device's responsibility to its owner is advisable.

* At the platform level, devices should give us options aligned with our own interests--rather than in the interests of increasing engagement metrics for media companies, and should present those options in a way that lets us choose well.

* This requires giving us informed, expressive, and social choices.

* Enabling informed choice may require that options listings be augmented with likely time costs, likely money costs, the unlikelihood of various hoped-for outcomes, the likelihood of unhoped-for outcomes, whether there are less-costly or better-success-rate options for similar outcomes, and even whether our hopes themselves are likely to change.

* Enable expressive choice means that options presented must relate to values and outcomes that are or that could be important to us.

* A public data service about people, choices, and outcomes could change search costs and behavior.

* These models of informed choice, expressive choice, and collective wisdom relate to microeconomics of addiction, behavioral economics, and current social issues like obesity, depression, a lack of meaningful work, sexual dysfunction, clickhole media / the buzzfeedification of media, and "internet addiction".
