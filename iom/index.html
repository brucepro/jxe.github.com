# Internet of Meaning

**The Internet of Meaning** refers to four proposals together which provide a foundation for internet use that's aware of users' desires for how they want to spent time.  This is to address *feed burnout*, *notification burnout*, to enable *smarter recommender systems*, and to help users live the lives they want.

There are four new internet standards: **Situation Cookies**, **HTML5 Doables**, the **futuremark URL scheme**, and a new exchange format and protocol for **Proofs of Relevance** that allow sources of review/engagement data and recommender systems to interoperate with one another.

## Situation Cookies

A "situation cookie" is a short text string used by clients to get contextually meaningful recommendations, and to report back in reviews whether a recommendation or a set of activities was contextually meaningful or not.  

Includes the following information about a user:

* location at the neighborhood level
* general time availability
* desires about how they want to spend their time (exercise, learning, downtime, etc) and optional time allotments for each
* numeric estimates about the likelihood of friends joining for different activity types
* optionally, one or more subject matter focii or interests

Example format:

* for someone in SF who wants to spend some time with friends and has an interest in art, and who has a close friend they often do things with.

	     X-Situation: "sfo art time_with_friends:3h,0.4,0.2"

Reference Client:

* The Sand Calendar App and Browser and the No Regrets Chrome extension both use the situation cookie format.  The browser within Sand adds the HTTP header to requests.  The GLDB reference recommender system uses the header to create customized most-popular lists.

Stakeholders:

- YELP, Google Now, FB Newsfeed


## HTML5 Doables

"Doables" is a metadata vocabulary with which an HTML5 page can be marked up (via the <meta> tag) or a region on a page can be marked up (using microdata's itemtype= and itemprop= attributes) as containing an activity which might be recommended in certain situations.

A page or a page region that specifies an activity has a basic type (using the schema.org or Open Graph vocabularies for things like "book", "video", "game", "event", "creative project" etc).   It also has:

* a set of verbs (a how-to video can be "viewed" or "done")
* for each verb, a set of situations in which it might be appropriate; for instance, when the user has 5 minutes available for learning, or when they are in SF looking for sunshine
* optionally, further instructions, durations, and facilitating URLs for each verb

Example Format:

		<meta property="og:type" content="music.song" />
		<meta property="doable:listen:takes" content="3 minutes" />
		<meta property="doable:listen:recommend_for" content="downtime" />

Stakeholders

- EventBrite, Meetup, DIY, Groupon, schema.org team, Open Graph team 

Reference Clients:

* Our reference recommender system *GLDB*, includes a scraper for this format.


## futuremark: url scheme

The futuremark standard combines "read it later" / Google Keep / Pocket / Reading List type uses with aspirational calendaring ("I want to run 3x/wk") and traditional calendaring, and provides these services with a common URL scheme.

A futuremark is like a bookmark, but is reserved for things the users has said they really want to fill a part of their life with.  Futuremarks can be generated by applications and websites for anything the user may wish to resume (e.g. planning a trip, writing a document), periodically reschedule (e.g., yoga classes from a provider), or periordically re-engage with (e.g. exercise suggestions).  

Example Format:

    	futuremark://exercise?
    		suggestions_url=http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=exercise+park%26find_loc=%%
    		&suggestions_desc="Suggestions from Yelp for Parks to exercise in"
    		&image=http://example.com/images/runner.png

Stakeholders:

- Pocket, iCal, etc

Reference clients:

* The Sand Calendar app opens futuremark: URLs by adding them to the dock for easy scheduling, and by providing a button to get suggestions a thte suggestions_url once schedulde.

## Proofs of Relevance

The problem of recommending verb/url pairs ("watch this video", "go to this restaurant") as relevant to a users' situation is, when considered across all URLs and all situations, a significant information organization and knowledge problem, especially considering the localization of such knowledge and the perverse incentive for URL owners to want their URLs to seem relevant in more situations than they really are.

The "Proof of Relevance Packet" (PORP) is a step towards interoperable and hard-metric proofs of relevance, rather than using system-internal, relatively unsharable, and indirect measures like clicks, views, and "most popular" pages.

Many types of provable user-observations need to be expressible:

- clicked
- scrolled and clicked
- viewed/read
- liked/shared 
- futuremarked 
- bookmarked
- scheduled/proposed to friend
- returned to
- shared or reviewed positively, later
- explicitly reported as comparative Time Well Spent

Stakeholders:

* all sites with activities, recommnder sites, browser vendors, OS vendors

Example Format:

		Situation USER-TIMEFRAME type-of-preference prefered-activity *not-prefered-activities crypotographic-token

Example Exchange Protocol:

		activitylist = "period {verb:type:role}URL[t0-t1;recommender] {verb:type:role}URL[t0-t1;recommender]"   
		           ||= "*"

		POST /prefer?in=situation,prefer=activitylist,to=activitylist

		GET /urls?urls=...

			URL => {
				in_situation: { prefered: [{to: [], by: {}}, {over:[], by: {}}] }
			}

		GET /most_regretted?in=situation
		GET /least_regretted?in=situation
		GET /adjacent_situations?in=situation

Reference clients:

* The Sand calendar app and the No Regrets chrome extension will both make users' ratings available as Proofs of Relevance.  The GLDB reference recommender will consume them to create better, customized most-popular lists.


## Summary

In order for the internet to take care of people right...

* *Bookmarks* need to become statements about things you want in your future life; **futuremark: url scheme**

* Our limited information about the users situation, via *ad cookies*, *likes*, search history, etc, must be replaced with **situation cookies**--a simple, potentially anonymous, socially aware standard description of the users' *situation*, including location and time-desires.

* User-facing *URLs about activities* needs various **HTML5 & DNS metadata additions** so that recommender algorithms can understand in which situations it is appropriate to recommend that URL.

* Instead of walled-gardens of ratings and profiles, we want to encourage a corpus of available data re **users' preferences** (expressed as sets of URLs over other sets in various situations).  Exchange of this information should be possible so as to create better recommenders and better products.
