# Towards a WWW of High Contextual Relevance 

We are stuck recommending popular links and "top picks" so long as we have little understanding of the users' actual situation and desires, and how to contribute to them.  In order to overcome this, we need: (a) a model of the context that users are in when they are using the web or apps, including location, social context, and their desires for their time; and (b) open information about what material is *truly* relevant to various contexts and people, rather than merely clickbait.

It is therefore of interest to devise both: (a) precise serialization formats for users' contexts and time-desires, and (b) cryptographically secure systems for proving that the data at a URL was *actually helpful* to one or more individuals in various contexts, insofar as this is possible.

These systems must be secure, given the incentive for URL owners and App providers to want their URLs, Apps, and App notifications to seem relevant in more situations than they really are.  The user's time and attention is all that they have, and these proofs are its defense.


## Internet of Meaning

The grand aim is to rewrite the relationships between these four parties: (1) recommender systems and feeds like facebook newsfeed and google now, (2) "content/activity provider" websites that propose activities to users like youtube, meetup, and instructables, (3) review, rating, and engagement metrics providers like yelp, bitly, quantcast, the sharing sites, etc, and (4) the users themselves and their agents, like Chrome and Pocket.



## Advertising Analytics vs Contextual Relevance Information

Currently, companies like Quantcast use demographic and psychographic information to predict what different people will reliablly click on or purchase.  We propose to use information about a users' situation and context to enable prediction (by third party recommendation engines, browser plugins, etc) of what different people will find time well spent.  These systems are similar in structure and purpose, even to the point of involving some of the same inputs, like other users' clicks, views, and scrolls.  We differ in desiring an ecosystem of open, secure data, competing recommender systems, user control, and a broad focus on self-reported lives well lived.


## Information about Contextual Relevance

Most estimates of contextual relevance on the web are rudimentary, and don't necessarily establish that a link or notification was actually helpful.  Nonetheless, it is of interest to ask how we could securely prove that the following rudimentary signals actually occurred for distinct humans in particular situations:

- user clicked headline
- user scrolled to headline and clicked
- user viewed/read/scrolled to bottom/watched to end
- user liked/shared/recommended broadly
- user bookmarked for later review

We would also like to encourage more sophisticated measures:

- user returned to resource intentionally
- user scheduled/invited/forwarded to friend
- user attended/used and reviewed positively
- user shared, reviewed, or forwarded after significant elapsed time
- user futuremarked (defined below)
- user explicitly reported as comparative Time Well Spent


## Proofs of Relevance

Proving that a particular click or a view duration occurred and involved a human in a self-reported situation is not difficult with client-side support, a trusted DHT (distributed, redundant) database, and an agreed-upon identity system, and--like the Neilsen ratings--the data can be of use to many even if it is only recorded by some, as client adoptions will not be immediate or complete.

Of interest is how to aggregate this information for exchange in an anonymous but cryptographically verifiable form.  We are optimistic that a crypto approach using homomorphic encryption is straightforward. 


## Circumstances for Exchange

Currently click and view data for websites can be a hoarded and valuable resource.  Facebook, for instance, does not publish click data about headlines on newsfeed.  Google doesn't publish which of its recommended links have long read times.  Services like Alexa and Compete.com make only the broadest aggregate data available, and quantcast charges for it.

We believe there is an opportunity to disrupt this situation with open data, standard formats, and client-side support for the production and verification of proofs.  Recommender algorithms should have the widest possible pool of data on which to act, and activity-source sites like DIY.org and Meetup.com should be able to leverage their proofs of relevance in an open market of recommenders.


## Comparative Time Well Spent

The issue of how to get the highest possible relevance signal from a single user bears some consideration.  Clearly we sometimes read entire articles or watch entire videos that, if given a redo, we might choose to have skipped.

Indeed, at least in retrospect, we evaluate time choices on the margin and in relation to opportunity costs.  If we discover that another event was going on or discover a new hobby, we might suddenly come to regret time choices we made in the past, before that discovery.

The only time choices that are safe from this kind of downward reevaluation are those where the comparison is done at the time of review, and for which the reported value of the time-choice is high enough as to dwarf the search costs and expected outcome of further comparison.  These are the activities that are Time Well Spent, in an absolute sense.

While this may seem like a high bar for web activities, the truth is that people will report many of their most treasured time-choices as comparative Time Well Spent:  time with their children, camping with best friends, a good cry, a quiet moment sipping tea and writing in one's journal... these kinds of activities are often reported as unassailable even given extensive comparative engagements.

Only by supporting these strong proofs of relevance can we hope to bring web use up to this standard.


## Characterizing the User's Situational Context

There are many kinds of link relevance.  Advertisers on facebook use demographic and psychographic information together with the users' likes and their friends' likes to pick links to display.  Newsfeed itself uses recent behavior of friends together with general engagement metrics like the ones we propose above.  Google uses keyword searches both for advertising for its main results page, together with a raft of engagement and other trust metrics.

All of these user-specific measures have biases:  keyword search is biased towards directed, intentional actions, especially research and purchases.  Activities and URLs that are not about directed research or purchasing will see lower incidence of recommendation because search engines will not recognize those aspects of situational context.  Recommendation based on friends' activities is biased towards "the news of the day" and away from anything individual or directed.  Recommendation based on demographic and psychographic information is biased towards least-common-denominator exploitation of human interests or susceptability.

After a year of experimentation with over 3000 subjects and a variety of different situational framings, we have settled on a framing based on neighborhood-level location, sociographic information (e.g., information about friends' availability, proximity, and willingness), and a small set of keywords we call *time-desires*, which capture what most people want to fill their lives with (e.g., "quality time with friends and loved ones", "learning", "time outdoors", "exercise", "quiet time", "creative projects", and "the unknown").

The situation descriptor we're proposing is small enough to be used as an HTTP header and can answer questions like:

- Is the user out on the town, if so, what neighborhood?
- Are they with, or do they wish to invite, a friend?
- How much free time do they have?
- What kinds of activities and friendships are important to them this week?
- Are there certain interests or skills they specifically wish to follow or learn about this week?

For example:

		X-Situation: sfo art time_with_friends:3h,0.4,0.2

		(in SF, wants to spend time with friends, has an interest in art, 
		has a close friend they often do things with)


## Hints by Page Authors

When a URL-addressed resource is first published there will be little or no review information about it, and recommender systems will not be able to make a decision based on proofs of relevance.  It is therefore advisable for page authors to be able to provide hints to recommenders about which situational contexts their resource is relevant to.

"Doables" is a metadata vocabulary with which an HTML5 page can be marked up (via the &lt;meta&gt; tag) or a region on a page can be marked up (using microdata's itemtype= and itemprop= attributes) as containing an activity which might be recommended in certain situations.

A page or a page region that specifies an activity has a basic type (using the schema.org or Open Graph vocabularies for things like "book", "video", "game", "event", "creative project" etc).   It also has:

* a set of verbs (a how-to video can be "viewed" or "done")
* for each verb, a set of situations in which it might be appropriate; for instance, when the user has 5 minutes available for learning, or when they are in SF looking for sunshine
* optionally, further instructions, durations, and facilitating URLs for each verb

Example Format:

		<meta property="og:type" content="music.song" />
		<meta property="doable:listen:takes" content="3 minutes" />
		<meta property="doable:listen:recommend_for" content="downtime" />
