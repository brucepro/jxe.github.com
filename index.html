Hello!  I design things to be more like *playgrounds*--things we don't usually think of as playgrounds, like theater, abandoned buildings, social networking sites, or the global economy. I redesign these things as playgrounds.  By which I mean *environments for navigating with agency amongst fulfilling experiences*.

My work takes the emphasis on *navigation* from theme park design, museum exhibits, and urban planning and applies it to economics, game design, experience design, the internet, and finding what we need in life in general.

### <a id="theory"></a> The Theory of the Playground <span vous="discuss"</span>

This is about designing playgrounds, by which I mean *environments for navigating with agency amongst fulfilling experiences*.

As systems designers, we have a great deal of experience designing systems of control, which limit or funnel or eliminate agency.  We also have practiced designing commodified marketplaces, in which agency exists only as an endless series of individual choices among like objects, unrelated to social realities or to our own best wishes for ourselves.

The playground stands as an alternate model for designing systems of navigation and search and engagement, for organizing options for a child in a class, a website user, a mobile device user, a pedestrian on a street, or an economic actor in a marketplace. 

Here are 8 principles for designing playgrounds--for creating systems that people can navigate together to find fulfilling experiences. 



#### 8 Principles



1. The activities on the playground make sense for a life well lived.

We come to the playground to play, to connect with friends, to challenge ourselves, to adventure, to build, to relax, etc--for the simple things that make life worth living.  We feel good about time on the playground because the playground affords time well spent.

Everything we might do on the playground takes time.  The same can be said of the items on facebook newsfeed, of the pages on the human-readable internet, of every store in every shopping mall.

If you've never done so before, it's worth asking your friends to draw their ideal week: how much time they'd spend with their friends and family, how much alone, how much learning or outside or engaged in creative projects, etc.

Most often, when we discuss the evenings, days, and weeks that make life worth living, we talk about experiences of connection, wonder, teamwork, adventure, etc.  

Therefore, when we place activities in front of a person, we have a responsibility to address their ideal week, their sense of time well spent and life well lived.

The activities of a playground are compatible with each player's sense of a life well lived.  For facebook newfeed, or the internet, or a shopping mall to become a playground, everything that is not part of a life well lived must be thrown out or easily evaded.




2. The playground is the player's to navigate in their own way.

Personalities vary, and so do personal styles for navigating engagement with a system.  Broadly, there is variation in the quickness with which a player will engage with another player, and variation in the quickness with which they'll involve themselves in an action or task.  Most playgrounds will have wanderers, gamers, confederates, and performers.  The wanderers will be slow to engage with both people and actions, and the performers will be quick on both accounts.

If there is a message in playgrounds, it is one of personal agency.  The playground is not a funnel or a call to action. Nor is it a marketplace of commodities.  They playground is a navigable system of heterogenous experiments.

It is important to avoid the performative control of entertainment and performance art fascism, which demands that you sit and watch or follow along in an expected path.

We do not create experiences for other people, we offer a playground for others to navigate as they wish.  Avoid the twin dangers of authorial direction and of disempowering & meaningless individual choice.




3. The playground reveals the true, embedded nature of choice.

When we leave the playground we fall into an illusion that's been created for us about the nature of "personal" choices.  It appears as though we might decide "I'm going to this event" or "I like this video."

The playground reveals that our choices are usually provisional, invitational, or suggestive, rather than truly personal.  Our choices are actually of the form "I will if you will" or "why don't we" or "here is an example" or "I'll join you in" or "this I believe in."

To choose an activity on the playground is to lead a friend, or to hope for a friend, or to invite a stranger with your mere presence, or perhaps even just to enter into a reverie with some equipment or the landscape.  The act of rapport and the act of choice cannot be other than simultaneous and it is a conceit unique to consumerism and our tech landscape that we make choices constantly without realising that each choice is as much a planning of others' lives as of our own.

On some days we may play with the authors of books or the shapers of landscapes now far away, we very rarely play alone, and even the act of sitting quietly with a book in a public space is an act of leadership or following.  The playground lays this bare.





4. The playground gives us time to find our courage. To summon our best selves. 

Our best moments, so often, are those that evoke our best selves.  And it is often a challenge (weighty or offhand), the support of a friend, or some quiet mental preparation, that allows us to become someone ready for what we'll later regard as a moment well lived.

This kind of choice contains an entire emotional arc, and it starts with an image of who we want to be.  A concrete technique is to provide a double opt-in, a mysterious call to action.  Ask the player "Are you ready for an adventure? (y/n)" before letting them through the outer gate.

Make room for whichever transitional space, whether prepatory or social, affords the amassing of courage, will, vulnerability, or whatever is called for.





5. The playground encourages shared commitments that are right-sized for generosity.

A well-structured landscape of activities is also well-structured for social generosity and welcoming.  The playground is an environment for "speed dating" and for experimenting with different kinds of rapport with either strangers and friends.

It is the small commmitment of a time-defined and structured activity, together with a broad set of rapports it affords, that allows us to be the most welcoming and experimental that we can be.

The playground transmits information about involvement in such a way that those who are more involved know to welcome those who are considering involvement, and they can do so with a nod or a smile, with an experimental attitude, and without undue consequence.

Screen-mediated activities are also well positioned for the issuing of surprise welcomes: an easy message from an in-group to a user contemplating involvement, delivered so as to invite engagement but without pressure.

The idea that we should join a website or close a bug alone without welcome is a strange perversion of the order of things.




6. The playground leaves room for dreaming, and furnishes elements for dreaming with.

The modern obsession with programmed content as the form of entertainment interferes with that more important kind of personal and emergent content: the content of our own lives and of the adjacent possible.  

When an illusion is too complete, too coherent, too designed, there is no room to put our own meaning into it, or to use it as a tool for thought for thinking about our own life.  An important quality of tools for thought is that they be empty and tactile and afford reflection and visceral experimentation.

Dreaming happens amonst broad categories and placeholder simplicities and empty spaces and times.  Architypes and pictures and currents in human life like sunshine and love and wildness.  Even a merrigoround lets you play with these experiences.  So must the playground.



7. The playground has obstacles to habitual, uninspired motion.

Our personal habits of navigation and the social codes around navigation (both navigation of architectural/public space and navigation of time options, more generally) keep us from otherwise-available experiences of fulfillment, dreaming, and engagement.

We can structure navigation so as to conn people out of these habits and social codes, using techniques from conn artistry, theme park design, game design, mythmaking, and immersive theatre.

Whether our habits are about waiting in line, talking without admitting feelings, walking from point a to point b, thumb scrolling until we get bored, or checking our phone's homescreen... there is a world out there.  The playground puts an obstacle underfoot. 




8. The playground transmits the right kind of excitement.

There are many kinds of excitement or engagement.  There has always been "the news of the day" which creates discussion but soon lapses into obscurity, and indeed even on some playgrounds there may be games and activities which have a line stretching around them just because they have a line, and people get in line because others are in line.

But the playground is home to another kind of excitement, based on a accumulated wisdom about which games and activities are most fulfilling for players to play.

Ambient information about what's likely to be near-term fulfilling is powerful: players reorient towards fulfilling choices, and they will invent a new, fulfilling game to play in a new area, rather than be stuck in the sidelines.

After years of confusing marketing, we are hungry for accurate data about which choices we are unlikely to regret.  We are grateful when better options are highlighted, and we tend to take them and feel better about our lives.  

The playground maintains it's capacity for being time well spent by transmitting the right kind of excitement, ensuring that the right activities are invented and thrive.






### <a id="connection"></a> Social Software as a Playground for Teamwork and Connection with Strangers <span vous="discuss"</span>

Under what circumstances do strangers come together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Communities) [2](#groundcrew), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

Work at CouchSurfing was especially valuable: we could live-test different preparations and funnels for strangers meeting one another.  We had opportunities to tune profiles (including review copy via review prompts), to tune search and matchmaking algorithms, and to tune the preparatory messages we send to both sides of a homestay before they meet up in person.  The reviews that users post are stories they tell about their experiences, and this gave us wonderful and rapid feedback about our changes.

**Learned**: there are many ways to prepare strangers so as to increase trust, openness, etc.  Tricks like double opt-ins, prompting welcome messages from peers, structuring interactions through a shared experience or task, and a careful ramp-up of intimacy can make 10-100x differences in conversions to positive and connected experiences.


#### Connection and teamwork games you can play yourself

* **Clandestine Film School** involves two decks of cards and a pack of hair clips, and is meant to be played in cafes where people work with their laptops and might like to work together instead.  One deck is a deck of "role cards" -- "director", "actor", "star", "interviewer", "cameraman".  The other has missions -- "a 6sec love story about mugs", "a 2min doco about lives of baristas", "a very subtle action adventure", etc.  Someone gives out cards and those who have roles and need to join mission team wear the hairclips.  Hashtags collect the media.  *Presented at SandboxSF in July '13 and played at Arbor in Oakland*.  <span vous="play" topic="Clandestine Film School"></span>

* **10 Challenges for New Friends** (2013) - Who else is tired of adding new friends on the internet without a good way to get to know them?  I made a challenged-based game for processing new interesting people and getting to know them.  Please feel free to make your own.  [Link](http://edelwax.tumblr.com/post/58978561014/10-challenges-for-new-friends)

* **A Getting-to-know-you card game** (2012) - A simple game where cards dealt prompt successively riskier personal stories.  ([Rules](http://edelwax.tumblr.com/post/31384959456/a-getting-to-know-you-game-using-a-deck-of-cards-and-a))   <span vous="play" topic="GTKY Cards"></span>

* **Tryst** (2011)&mdash;This is a [CEML script](#ceml) that you can modify and run at conferences, etc.  It arranges rendezvous between strangers at the conference who text in, where they share things they noticed at the conference. Run first at the <a href="http://openengagement.info/">Open Engagement</a> conference in Portlant in 2011. Script written with <a href="http://thachr.com">Sara Thacher.</a>  (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1945964">script file</a>)  (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1893654825104&set=a.1891648734953.2104507.1353540046&type=3&theater">photos</a>)  <span vous="play" topic="Tryst"></span>

* **Infatuated** (2012) -- Another [CEML script](#ceml).  This one is design for pairing up visitors to an art gallery.  It pairs up strangers who begin by watching each other at a distance as they interact with the art and eventually meet.  Written with/by Sam Lavigne and Ian Kizu-Blair of Situate Design.  [Script file](https://docs.google.com/a/citizenlogistics.com/document/d/1_U_axTZJ9EMuIvq60I6cQd00L91uUuz7PNPwkTAH_8k)

* **Various Theater Games and Warmups for Contact Improvisers** (2006) -- [A small booklet](/pdf/scorebook.pdf) for dancers.  <span vous="play" topic="Theater Games"></span>


#### Technology

I've created software for forming just-in-time opt-in teams with high opt-in rates and high performance.  These have been tested in environments ranging from art museum openings to disaster sites.

* **Cadre Events** is a mobile web- and sms-based interface for talking groups of people texting in at the same event and funneling them in chatrooms that coordinate group actitivies between strangers.   [screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/90olm7apkfbg374/d4SNqanDFn)

* See also Groundcrew and CEML, below.



#### Ongoing events

I run a monthly playtest for realworld games and a yearly festival in SF.  Many of the games presented by others involve just-in-time teamwork, and often they are also about turning nonaffiliated strangers into affiliated groups in some public or semi-public-space venue.

#### Experiments

* **Breakfast Voting** (1993) - When I was 16, on a whim I asked a few thousand
  strangers on the internet to vote on what I should have for breakfast.
  They formed teams, put forward proposals, and made connections 

* *Trustfall Dinner* (2001)&mdash;
   A computer program was used to scramble the
  instructions of several gourmet recipes and to assign guests at
  the dinner party cooking tasks in such a manner that it was
  difficult for anyone to guess what was being prepared until the
  very end. A primary focus was on the mechanics of danger and
  trust -- for instance, in having one participant leave something
  prone to burning on the stove and having another participant
  remove it.

* *Ruby Goldberg Instruction Series* (2005-) -- Everyone at an open mic or other gathering sends a text message and receives one back from a server.  Each text has an instruction with a trigger event and an action to be taken by the recipient, for instance: "Take off your shoe. When you hear the bell, step into the aisle and hold up your shoe and shake it."  Someone else would receive: "When you see someone shaking one of their shoes in the air, begin to tell a short (20 second) story about your childhood."

* *Card Parties* (2002-2011) -- detailed above.

* *Cadre Events, Missions* -- the *Cadre Events* software mentioned above was deployed and refined at events at YBCA, CoAPSF 2011, and at several Occupy Wall Street sites!  Here are [some missions from CoAP](https://hackpad.com/Cadre-Events-missions-from-COAP2011-ZXCE1SjUZ4y)

* **EarthSync** (2006)&mdash;A social calendar-sharing website.  Allowed 
  you to see what all of your geographically-dispersed friends are doing
  today and "sync-up" by doing the same thing at the same time.

* **Share a Quiet Moment with a Distant Stranger** (2006)&mdash;A web installation.  
  Spend a minute or two in synchronous silent contemplation with a
  stranger somewhere else on Earth. Users are given the relative compass 
  bearing and degreesbelow-the-horizon of their companions, so as to more
  fully feel "with" them in contemplation.

* **CouchSurfing**

* **Inaction at a Distance** (2003)&mdash;
  Site-specific performance.  Two people stand quietly, shoulder
  to shoulder, 250 miles apart, for 10 minutes.  Synchronized to
  atomic time, they inhale at the same moment to begin.
  Performed three times in NYC and VT.

* **Geoloitering** (2003)&mdash;
  Email/physical installation. For more than a month, I spent part
  of each day standing quietly in Vermont while elsewhere in the
  world (Ireland, Australia, New Mexico, Japan, etc) a complete
  stranger was also standing quietly

* **Invoke** (2000)&mdash;
  Web/physical installation.  A gift-exchange community was
  created. Participants were making, hiding, and finding postcards
  in back pages of low-circulation books in the San Francisco
  public library. Each user would enter the call number and page
  of a book within which he or she would like to receive a
  postcard, and within a week another user would place one there.

* **Continuous Play** (2008)&mdash;A performance collaboration with
  choreographer <a href="http://www.inmixedcompany.com/">Maura Donohue</a> in
  which the audience switches from passive to very active performers,
  directed via SMS, over the course of the evening.

### <a id="conning"></a> Habit-Breaking Playgrounds <span vous="discuss"></span>

When people discuss the evenings, days, and weeks that make life worth living, they talk about experiences of connection, wonder, teamwork, adventure, etc.  We miss out on opportunities for experiences like these for all kinds of social, economic, and personal reasons.  Our pedestrian and experiential habits form an important class of these obstacles.  A simple way to intervene is to understand the personal habits of navigation and the social codes around navigation (both navigation of architectural/public space and navigation of time options, more generally) that keep people from otherwise-available experiences they would review highly, and to learn to conn people out of these habits.

We use techniques from conn artistry, theme park design, game design, mythmaking, and immersive theatre to interfere with these habits and social codes.

#### <a id="codered"></a>Ongoing events

Since 2011, I've co-lead a crew that makes immersive experiences in public space.  Often simple.  Often beautiful.  Sometimes vaguely illegal.  These events are all multi-party markets in interaction and rapport.  They are physical markets, just like a farmer's market, and we have been making adjustments to optimize the emergence of the right audience-member / fulfilling experience transactions.

* [Photos from our events](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pt5k3bg48j33utr/SHoH1sOsWU)


#### Interaction games you can play yourself 

* **Numbers**.  This is a super-simple game you can play at any kind of event.  If you have twenty guests, pass out twenty slips of paper, numbered 1-20.  The goal is to end the evening with the number 1.  Announce that anyone can, if they find someone with a number lower than theirs, ask for a challenge.  The challenge should be possible and ideally, fun.  If they succeed, they get to trade for the lower number.  What happens is that people make more and more creative challenges for one another, and the challenges become lightweight designed experiences that are reproduced on their own merits.  *Played at COaPSF 2012 and many dinenr parties.*   <span vous="play" topic="Numbers"></span>

* **Pantheon** - a theater piece for 12 actors that need to be unlocked by the audience.  In *Pantheon*, every actor gets a binder of games to play and stories to exchange with audience members, and makes a secret decision before the show about what kind of presentation from an audience member will wake them from silence.  The binders are being collaboratively written.  [Join us!](https://hackpad.com/PANTHEON-iLG8ZLrtOIu)  <span vous="play" topic="Pantheon"></span>

* **Yenta** - *down for the moment, help me get it back up* - an webapp that watches the twitter public feed for people that feel "bored" or are asking for something from "anyone".  When it finds two people who are both bored at the same time and live near one another, it asks the user if they'd like to suggest something for both people to do together.  This becomes a double @reply introducing the pair.  The user scores a point if their suggestion drives engagement between the two.

* **Microperformance potluck** - This is a kind of event where people get together to eat and participate in eachother's projects.  Each attendee brings a thing for the whole group to do together or to witness in less than 2 minutes.  A timer is set and if any partipant uses more than two minutes of the group's time, they are tackled and carried out of the room by the audience.  [Flyer](/pdf/micropotluck2.pdf)



#### Experiments

* **Northampton Adventure Exchange** (2007) -- Residents of the small town of Northampton, MA filled out an online form where they specified a kind of quality they wanted to have added to their lives.  The choices included "surprise", "peace and quiet", "danger", "challenge", "warmth", etc.  They also reported their schedules.  A massive potluck was held once a week in which 30+ people attempted to pair up people from the database and make adventures for them to go on together which related to their desires.

* **Take to the Streets Radio** (2005)&mdash;was a radio show and weekly street event for more than a year. We give listeners instructions every week for public space adventures near the centers of Northampton and Florence, MA.  Each week there was a guest adventure designer.

* **Wish-fulfillment Card Parties** (2006,2007) -- At daylong events with 300 people, everyone was asked to make a wish for something that could realistically happen to them at the event that they would love.  A team of 30 people used a group editing and revision process to derive assignments for all 300 that, taken together, would make each person's wish come true.




### <a id="agency"></a> Social Network Feeds and Activity Recommender Systems as Playgrounds <span vous="discuss"></span>

Many website and apps consist of an organization of various opportunities for use of the user's time.  As such, these organizational schemes package notions of what the user cares about and how they make decisions, and these notions affect the users' psychology, outlook, and planning procedures.  We look at different IA approaches and their effect on the user, their self-conception, and their planning procedures.

#### Tech and Demos

* <a id="sand"></a>**Sand** is a calendar app that helps you visualize your life and makes it easy to add exercise, friend dates, and the things that make you happy to your week.  [Screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oi23wtqpolnlnqx/_1zjdsT4Vx).

* **Bright Ideas** is a directory of easy and more satisfying things you could do with your friends.  [Screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hzzsdtcjzh4pv55/jvoZ8M0YYm)


#### Experiments

* Using the *Bright Ideas* interface above, we asked a few thousand people in the bay area to check if they saw better ideas for things to do with their friends (and better friends to do them with) and if they did, they made plans using the app and facebook or text messaging.  Some of these participants were tracked longitudinally and we saw surprising levels of lifestyle change.  This was not a scientific study, but we hope to make data available, and we would love to work with scientists on a proper redo with a control group, etc.

* [Northstar](http://www.northstarteens.org) is an [unschool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) in Western Mass where teenagers are asked every week what they would like to do with their week.  This simple act seems to precipitate significant lifestyle and activity changes.  As a board member for two years I had a chance to observe and take part in this process.















### <a id="acn"></a> The Internet as a Playground <span vous="discuss"></span>

The early internet was conceptualized as a network of **addressable hosts**, and newer approaches present a network of **hashed content**. We explore a third tack, organizing and navigating the internet as a network of **potential activities** for users. Hosts, content, and services may contribute to activities and may present the same or similar/substitutable activities. Metadata like duration and desires-fulfilled becomes important to the organization of the internet, and new modes of browsing are possible.


#### Tech and Demos

* **GLDB** is a nascent public database of which activities people feel best about at least a week after the fact, and which lifestyles feel best to the people who live them, relative to lifestyles they've had in the past.  It includes [an API](https://github.com/timewellspent/gldb/tree/master/gldb-server) for asking about whether URLs are likely to be long-term fulfilling, for making your own reports, and for querying fulfilling activities, and [a web scraper](https://github.com/timewellspent/gldb/blob/master/scraper/scraper.go) for parsing the web as activities rather than as content objects.

* **FulfillmentKit** is a javascript library of sample heuristics for guessing which activities (for example, from those presented by newsfeed) are most likely to be fulfilling for the user.  It could be useful in, say, a chrome extension for pruning newsfeed.  Or as an example to the authors of newsfeed algorithm and other recommender serveices.   [first demo](http://timewellspent.github.io/demos/recommender1/)



### <a id="lwl"></a> Microeconomics Evaluated in Playground Terms <span vous="discuss"></span>

What are the most fulfilling things that can happen to a person in an evening or a day?  An emotional breakthrough, a breathtaking vista, a playful conversation with a loved one, the resolution of a longstanding logistical or material problem, a return to an aspect of oneself...

The market for these fulfilling experiences is unusual in that provisioning experiences requires unusual insight into and influence over personality and state, and the criteria for consumer search are poorly understood by both consumers and providers.  These goods are all either experience goods or credence goods which means they cannot be selected from a catalogue.

It is instructive to create situations where there are many providers of potentially fullfilling experiences and many consumers, and various attempts to coordinate can be studied and engineered.

**Learned:** There is a certain regularity to the things that emerge as frequently fulfilling in these environments.  [Diagram of Desires and Rapports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlreore5l5rixmx/desires-and-rapports.pdf).  There is also regularity to the information we need about a person in order to address interactions and rapports they will engage in to them, and regularity to the ways that "vendors" of interaction and rapport need to present themselves in order to be browsable and engagable.



#### Writing

* [**Two Kinds of Demand**: Is our economy powered by activities (and pageviews) that we later regret?](https://medium.com/armchair-economics/a36c54b97ee1)



### <a id="lifestyle"></a> Dynamics of Lifestyle Change <span vous="discuss"</span>

An individual's pattern of consumption, production, and time allocation can change dramatically as a result of life events (graduation from HS or college, moving to a city), shifts in affiliation (marriage, divorce, club memberships, new friends), and personal realizations. Although motivating lifestyle change is key to addressing major problems like carbon emissions, obesity, and poverty, little is understood about the conditions that produce positive lifestyle change and how to engineer more of them. We can use activity and event attendance, social graph, and location data to track lifestyle change in a global population and offer suggestions for encouraging certain changes globally.

At couchsurfing we observed that users tended to change lifestyle as their affiliations changed.  And others have noted that who we affiliate with [is the major factor in determining lifestyle](http://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_christakis_the_hidden_influence_of_social_networks.html).  This led me to question whether it might be possible to migrate people to new, more fulfilling lifestyles using the social graph and activity search.

If social activity search and activity recommenders have the potential to change lifestyles dramatically, we can ask ourselves how we're doing on that front on the internet, and how we could do better.

Users of facebook newsfeed say yes to more than 200 million person-hours of activities recommended by newsfeed each day.  Anecdotally, in a casual survey, we observe that users tend to regret accepting those recommendations when the last week of activity is summarized in front of them.  This is a far cry from a migration to a life well lived.


### <a id="coord"></a> Expressive Environments for Coordination <span vous="discuss"></span>

Increasingly the expressive intent of artists and programmers involves connecting people in new ways and coordinating new forms of action. While languages that treat connections and coordination in the core semantics have started to appear (my own CEML, and Sep's Dog), the field is young and we are not yet in a place where an amateur can concoct new media with new interactional modes and/or new social forms of action without a great deal of forethought.

#### Technology

* <a id="ceml"></a>**CEML** is a programming language for coordination.  Please see [the documentation](https://github.com/citizenlogistics/ceml/blob/master/guide/guide.md) for sample code.  There used to be a hosted version of CEML that let you try it yourself and attach scripts to twilio phone numbers for text message coordination.  I hope to get it back up soon, but for now [install it yourself](http://github.com/citizenlogistics/ceml).

* <a id="groundcrew"></a>**Groundcrew** is a realtime teambuilding command console which was used by disaster relief agencies, city halls during snow storms, political and activist campaign coordinators, and field service and field medical companies. [screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7q0o8s921c8kzzi/2up-interagency.pdf) [a review](http://www.rebellionlab.com/2010/03/29/groundcrew-the-first-stage-of-location-based-services/) [video walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FPMGfAenZg)

* **LibDeck** is a javascript library that provides an abstraction for multi-person, multi-role scheduling and buy-in on top of primatives like chatrooms and invites.  Simple JSON objects describe the actvities that could be coordinated, and notions like cohosts and locations/transit directions have a programmatic representation.

#### Coordination games I've made that you can play

* **Card Parties** are events where guests at a party are assigned precisely-timed tasks, distributed on little cards or via SMS.  Tasks interweave. Strangers find themselves in intimate encounters, quiet moments, facing challenges together, being theatrical, etc.  I have [an old FAQ](/misc/notecard-party-faq.html) for running one of your own and [some software and a mission database](http://github.com/jxe/Participatorium) that will help.


## <a id="tentative"></a> Odds and Ends

I will be revising these things.

* There might be a better way to do [economics 101](https://hackpad.com/Lets-Modernize-Econ-101-YHCWZmsRMpc)
* I made an email client once.  I'll find screenshots on an old harddrive and post them.
* I have a kind of [design manifesto](http://greatmending.quora.com/Towards-an-Honest-Internet-Refocusing-the-Tech-Industry-on-Fulfillment-before-it-jumps-the-shark) up on quora, but it's out of date.
