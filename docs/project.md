# Beyond Engagement Metrics, Beyond Addictive Design

The architects of the television industry worked hard to keep people seated in front of the screen, but they had nothing on what's going on right now with mobile.

Notice the year-over-year increases in mass media consumption.  In 2011, they took 32 minutes of everyone's daily, in-person life.  In 2012, another 31 minutes.  In 2013, 14 minutes, and in 2014, 11 minutes.

Paul Graham, founder of ycombinator, [wrote](http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html) "most people I know have problems with Internet addiction."[1]  That was in 2010; the internet ate another 90 min of everyone's day since.  That's five years per life.

We must ask ourselves: is our collective choice to stare at glowing rectangles for 12.2 out of 16 hours per day a pure expression of our true preferences?  Or are we being manipulated to click and to scroll, much as the designers of malls and supermarket checkout aisles manipulate consumers to buy?  If the latter, what are the consequences of putting a non-elective, metrics-driven mall in our pocket, on our wrist, or over our eyes, instead of down the street?

If we *are* being manipulated, but we still want to use modern technology, then we must ask ourselves: what would a nonmanipulative technology stack look like?  In terms of design, what would a homescreen or a lock screen be like if it wasn't trying to maximize engagement with content, but rather to maximize the degree to which we lived the life we want?  In terms of algorithms, what would we replace newsfeed algorithm with if we cared more about one billion people living well than we do about FBOOK ad revenue, daily actives, or time-on-site?

It's my contention that, just as cities around the world have been shaped by a tradition of utopian architects and urban planners--visionaries who imagined public space with no other aim but to serve the public--we must now call forth utopian interface designers and utopian algorithm tuners.  Television was bad enough for our collective wellbeing.  Let's not embed buzzfeed-style virality on our wrists and foreheads.  Let's envision a tech stack that's actually for people.



## How?

One approach would be to try to create some utopian dream phone and social network, and then try to compete with the big companies to get everyone to use it.  We're taking a more nuanced, grassroots tack, inspired by the Organic food movement, LEED certification in architecture, the user-centered design movement, and tech-for-good movements like Gov 2.0.

We have three broad goals.

FIRST, to clearly articulate a new design methodology--one that respects individual values, aspirations, and time--and to have a handful of well-regarded designers and, hopefully, product teams, excited to practice it.

SECOND, to build a hacker community around algorithms and products built on new databases of "collective wisdom" and human values.  For instance, data from our Chrome extension that asks users why they are spending time with various sites, and whether it's working out.

THIRD, (and most nebulously) to establish consumer demand for a better tech stack.  This could take many forms--getting PR and traffic for a site full of demos and data visualizations; signups to a mailing list announcing conformant products; crowdfunding of a kickstarter for a particular product (say, a replacement for the android lockscreen).  We will take the time to find the best approach.

As examples appear, we believe users will clamour for more values-aligned tech.  The difference will lay bare how their lives have been warped by tech with values contrary to their own.



### Timeline

In the beginning of 2015 I will be polishing and giving a design methodology talk.  You can see an early draft version here:  xxx 

I will also be spending time polishing my chrome extension, Hindsight, which collects wisdom about web usage, why people do it, and how it works out for people.  It has a small group of alpha testers now.  It will have community features and exciting visualizations before my fellowship begins.


#### Month 1 & 2

* User testing and evolution of chrome extension
  (see https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hindsight/accbpganjjaadepnncaknjdkogbmgfbl)
* Work on design methodology packet (w. Aral, TH, Aza, Bret)
  (see http://nxhx.org/Choicemaking/ for draft material)


#### Month 3 & 4

* Ship design methodology packet to teams (Aral, etc) get impl. feedback
* Create a design methology pledge page for designers
* Ship API and cmdline tools for collective experience data
* Start hosting hackathons and meetups around collective experience data


#### Month 5 & 6

* Gather advisors for consumer demand projects
* Continue with hackathons and meetups
* Revise design methology and publish case studies / field reports


#### Month 7+

* Raise add'l funds (from Stripe, Mozilla, Bret, etc)
* Organize work on one or more demand projects:  a newsletter, a kickstarter for an android homescreen app, a series of dataviz stories, an ads-you-can-trust deploy / product hunt alternative, a little network of goal profiles
* Branding materials
* Plan a Tim O'Reilly-hosted conference on the stuff



### Budget

The following is a budget for the project for the year.  Not all of it must come from D&S: should I be accepted, I believe I'll be able to raise additional funding from other sources, even for my first six months.  It would be best if D&S contributed an amount that signaled a strong endorsement of the work.

* $40k - stipend for Joe Edelman, 1yr
* $25k (5x$5k) - to engage a series of designers and data visualizers to inspire exploration of collective experience data
* $6k - budget for a monthly events series
* $3k - travel
* total = $74k

I'm also looking forward to working with a strong community of scholars.


## Influences and Audiences

Our aim is to inspire **designers throughout the consumer tech industry**, as well as other **employees of the major platform companies** (Google, Apple, Facebook), and to convey a basic understanding of what sort of top-level OS interfaces would help people use their time according to their true values.  Much as the tech world discovered the importance of design over the last ten years, we hope to lead them to discover the importance of high quality choicemaking environments, by creating talks, demos, publicity.

We also hope to reach, intially through the chrome extension, a currently un-gathered group of reflective, introspective citizens worried about the impact of technology on their own lifes and others'.  We might call these people **qualitative selfers**:  like the *quantified self movement*, these are early adoptors and self-examiners; unlike QSers, they are critics of tech's advance into our lives and recognize that something needs to change about the man-machine interface before it is worth trusting as part of us.  The *indie tech* movement will be a fertile ground—we're lucky to have Aral Balkan as an advisor—and so will the media studies / designer overlap population represented by Bret Victor and friends.

Finally, there are certain companies that are in a position to help orchestrate or to benefit from a movement in tech based on time well spent.  There are companies like Meetup.com and DIY.org, both of which would likely receive increased attention under algorithms tuned to people's true values.  There are also gateway/marketplace companies, like Foursquare, Stripe.com, and various alternative app stores like Product Hunt, which could gain a PR benefit and serve their users by creating special shelf space for the tech products that are designed with our principles in mind.  I hope that, by then end of my residence, this case can made clearly.

* At the center of our site work is a new survey instrument.  A replacement for the five star review.  We call it a values-aware, retrospective review.  It's part of the chrome extension, visible at http://willandintent.org/cxp/, implemented in a library at htt://github.org/willpowered/hindsight
