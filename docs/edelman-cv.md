### HCI

* **Interval Research** - worked on the team that prototyped what later became the Kinect; developed rhythm recognition algorithms based on cogsci research to turn bodily flailing into intersting drumbeats

* **Citizen Logistics** - designed a programming language for coordinating workforces and built entire parser/runtime/IDE stack (github.com/citizenlogistics/ceml);  shipped a modded version of google maps v3 that supported fast simultaneous movement of 10k markers on screen for realtime workforce coordination (github.com/citizenlogistics/groundcrew-viewer);  lead development of three iphone and web apps, all for realtime coordination

* **Will & Intent** - prototyping software and internet architecture around ideas of collective wisdom and time well spent. Including: a chrome extension which asks you about your web use; a calendar app that helps you consider the balance of your day; a social network about our human values and how they change over time; etc.

## AI

* **Charles River Analytics** - used neural network object identification algorithms to stop air force bomber jets from bombing trees using LIDAR data
* **MIT AI Lab** - built early semantic web classifiers and web spidering tools to find arguments for and against various propositions on the open web as an experimental part of Al Gore's Reinventing Government project



* Successful products in stranger-stranger networking, workforce coordination, games, programming languages, and event listings.
