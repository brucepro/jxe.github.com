## Unifying vision

I study the economy as a thing with sensors and actuators.  The principal sensor, currently, is the consumer's decision to buy or not buy a thing at a certain price.  This is a crude way of detecting what people truly value.  The principal actuator, currently, is the firm, which is a heavyweight way to organize.  To upgrade the sensors, I study big data ways of detecting our true preferences (using locations, transactions, and by instrumenting and modifying mobile menus).  To upgrade the actuators, I focus on creative tools for lightweight coordination.  My work on detecting true preferences intersects with the foundations of microeconomics and the theory of choice.  I often structure my experiments as group games.


## CS, HCI

### identity, agency, and information architecture (hci)

The vast majority of IA consists of the organization of various opportunities for use of the user's time.  As such, these organizational schemes package notions of what the user cares about and how they make decisions, and these notions affect the users' psychology, outlook, and planning procedures.  We look at different IA approaches and their effect on the user, their self-conception, and their planning procedures.  {demos: Sand Calendar}

### activity-centric networking (cs/systems)

The early internet was conceptualized as a network of **hosts**, and newer approaches present a network of **content**.  We explore a third tack, organizing and navigating the internet as a network of **activities for users**.  Hosts, content, and services may contribute to activities and may present the same or similar/substitutable activities.  Metadata like duration and desires-fulfilled becomes important to the organization of the internet, and new modes of browsing are possible.  Extensions to FB Open Graph and a web rendering based on the CommonCrawl.org open web crawl are presented.  {demos: GLDB crawler; No Regrets chrome extension; Lifeworthy feed labeling; Opportunities API}

### mechanisms of reaffiliation (hci, sna)

Other SNA research has shown that our social affiliations can be the major stumbling blocks and/or enablers for health and lifestyle goals.   Here we present a set of concrete design elements for social apps which enable *reaffiliation* or the migration of the user along his/her social graph towards a more empowering group of friends.


### Signaling the possibility of rapport (hci, urban planning, psych) 

What are the ways that two people can get along with one another, online or offline, and what are the social affordances and information requirements of good teamwork, emotional sharing, intellectual connection, and the other common types of rapport?  A survey of an area of social design that needs to be gathered up, we present design motifs from mobile apps and from real world architecture and event planning, along with data about consequences for experiences of rapport and felt connection.

### Language Environments for Expressive Coordination (hci, programming languages, symbolic planning)

Increasingly the expressive intent of artists and programmers involves connecting people in new ways and coordinating new forms of action.   While languages that treat connections and coordination in the core semantics have  started to appear (my own CEML, and Sep's Dog), the field is young and we are not yet in a place where an amateur can concoct new media with new interactional modes and/or new social forms of action without a great deal of forethought. 


## ECON

### A social network analysis of lifestyle change (economic sociology & sna)

An individual's pattern of consumption, production, and time allocation can change dramatically as a result of life events (graduation from HS or college, moving to a city), shifts in affiliation (marriage, divorce, club memberships, new friends), and personal realizations.  Although motivating lifestyle change is key to addressing major problems like carbon emissions, obesity, and poverty, little is understood about the conditions that produce positive lifestyle change and how to engineer more of them.  We use activity and event attendance, social graph, and location data to track lifestyle change in a global population and offer suggestions for encouraging certain changes globally.


### calculating economic value for fulfilling experience (econ)

Deeply fulfilling experiences--whether hosting a picnic with friends, writing a song, or helping someone in need--can be hard to characterize in the universe of goods and services in traditional economics.  Even when there is a clear buyer, seller, and market (as with the Burning Man festival, psychotherapy, massage therapists, or CouchSurfing) the identification of fulfilling experience beforehand is difficult, and an assessment of value can often only be made my individuals after having had the experience (i.e., fulfilling experiences are usually *credence goods*). We present a variety of approaches for valuing fulfilling experience by collecting after-the-fact data and trading on it, both for experiences provisioned in a market and for self-provisioned experiences.


### scarcity and transaction costs in the market for fulfilling experience (econ)

In general, many people would pay to experience more fulfilling experiences in their free time, which is to say that fulfilling experiences are under-provisioned.  But are the prerequisites for fulfilling experience (e.g., other people, certain organizing skills, transportation, etc) actually scarce?  We take a survey of the most common and most reportedly fulfilling experiences and do an analysis of transaction and search costs to try to answer, in economic terms, the question: what is holding people up from living more fulfilling lives?



## ART

### alg. music for society

Music can facilitate rapport between strangers and friends.  Music can facilitate reflection and perspective.  The compositional process often includes social activity.  We look forward to the construction of an electro-acoustic musical and choreographic tradition that's more directly about generating a felt connection between strangers, both distant and nearby, and enabling a sense of perspective about social connections occurring around the world and about the various ways that inhabitants of earth are allocating their time and attention.  {compositions: study for player piano and facebook events API; romp for campfire harmonica and push notifications}


### pull theater

The in-person performing arts of the 20th century have featured passive audiences and push content.  Perhaps a more natural model has been lost in the process, in which audiences find performers and beg to be entertained or engaged.  In which performers need to be discovered and unlocked and the opportunities of performance unfurl as do the opportunities of life:  amidst the urban labyrinth and only with prodding and participation.  Play is already about search and practice.  Perhaps plays, too, can be.  {scripts: PANTHEON}
