### Software Engineering & Algorithms Research

* **Will & Intent** - prototyping software and internet architecture around ideas of collective wisdom and time well spent. Including: a chrome extension which asks you about your web use; a calendar app that helps you consider the balance of your day; a social network about our human values and how they change over time; etc.
* **Citizen Logistics** - designed a programming language for coordinating workforces and built entire parser/runtime/IDE stack (github.com/citizenlogistics/ceml);  shipped a modded version of google maps v3 that supported fast simultaneous movement of 10k markers on screen for realtime workforce coordination (github.com/citizenlogistics/groundcrew-viewer);  lead development of three iphone and web apps, all for realtime coordination
* **CouchSurfing** - invented the metrics and dashboards that drove the organization; developed the couchsearch algorithm which matches surfers and hosts using trust, reputation, and affinity data;  developed machine learning algorithms for keeping the site free of bad guys
* **Renesys** - developed planet-scale systems for monitoring, alerting, and logging about the realtime health of the internet, including BGP, ASN, router traffic, botnet activity, etc
* **Interval Research** - worked on the team that prototyped what later became the Kinect; developed rhythm recognition algorithms based on cogsci research to turn bodily flailing into intersting drumbeats
* **fMRI Data Center, Dartmouth** - developed semantic web search engines and ontology-based documentation, tagging, and analysis systems to simplify the reuse of scientific data sets
* **Computer-Aided Drug Design Lab, Dartmouth** - invented algorithms for discovering and evaluating protein-ligand binding sites based on geometric hashing which have been used to discover leukemia drugs
* **Charles River Analytics** - used neural network object identification algorithms to stop air force bomber jets from bombing trees using LIDAR data
* **MIT AI Lab** - built early semantic web classifiers and web spidering tools to find arguments for and against various propositions on the open web as an experimental part of Al Gore's Reinventing Government project
* **Harvard Medical** - built data analysis tools for realtime animal cardiovascular data

* **Eduction** - MIT (HSSP), Dartmouth College (BA, "Simulation in the Sciences");

* **Open source** commiter since 1993.  Patches to emacs, trn, zsh.
* **Scientific research** since 1995.  Contributions to HCI, CSSW, neuroinformatics, bioinformatics.
* Various projects in javascript, C, node, ruby, rubymotion, html5/css3, mongo, redis, mysql, objc/iOS, golang, python, etc


### Project Management & Operations

* **Citizen Logistics** (CEO) - ultimate responsibility for funding, hiring, and managing a team of 3-7, technical direction, and product releases; released one business and two consumer apps which were covered in the technical press, nytimes, etc
* **Come Out and Play** - co-managed a real-world games festival in SF that draws 6000 people to play new games out in the city, including busines relations, print and online materials, insurance, etc
* **CouchSurfing** - managed the engineers and engineering priorities during a period of rapid growth
* **Emergency Communities** - operations team for a soup kitchen / community center in post-Katrina New Orleans which served thousands three meals a day, including logistics of food suppliers and trucking, volunteer supply, etc

* other leadership and PM roles at the Gov't of Tibet in Exile, Skyfish.com, WGBH Television, and various small consultancies and shops



### Additional Creativity

* **Sand** - an iOS calendar app that reminds you of your mortality
* **OpenOutcomes** - the public data repository that will help people waste less time online
* **Analog Cupid** - a real-life dating site (i.e., a table in a park)
* More than 40 in-person **games and theatrical events** (see http://nxhx.org)
* Successful products in stranger-stranger networking, workforce coordination, games, programming languages, and event listings.
